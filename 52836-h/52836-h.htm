<h2>PREFATORY NOTE</h2>

<p>The American Bibliography is almost entirely the
work of Mrs. St. John of Ithaca, and is the result of
laborious and careful critical research on her part.
The French Bibliography is not so full. I have been
assisted in it mainly by M. Legouis at Lyons, and
by workers at the British Museum. I have also collected
a German Bibliography, but it is in too incomplete
a state for publication in its present form.</p>

<p>The English Bibliography is fuller than any of its
predecessors; but there is no such thing as finality in
such work, especially when an addition to the literature
of the subject is made nearly every week. Many kind
friends, and coadjutors, have assisted me in it, amongst
whom I may mention Dr. Garnett of the British Museum,
and <i>very specially</i> Mr. Tutin, of Hull, and also
Mr. John J. Smith, St. Andrews, and Mr. Maclauchlan,
Dundee. If I omit, either here or elsewhere, to record
the assistance which I have received from any one, in
my efforts to make this edition of Wordsworth as
perfect as is possible at this stage of literary criticism
and editorship, I sincerely regret it; but many of my
correspondents have specially requested that no mention
should be made of their names or their services.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Preface to the first volume of this edition
there was an unfortunate omission. In returning the
final proofs to press, I accidentally transmitted an uncorrected
one, in which two names did not appear. They
were those of Mr. Thomas Hutchinson, Dublin, and
Mr. S. C. Hill, of Hughli College, Bengal. The former
kindly revised most of the sheets of Volumes I. and II.,
and corrected errors, besides making other valuable suggestions
and additions. When his own Clarendon Press
edition of Wordsworth was being prepared for press,
Mr. Hutchinson asked permission to incorporate in it
materials which were not afterwards inserted. This I
granted cordially, as a similar permission had been
given to Professor Dowden for his Aldine edition. The
unfortunate omission of Mr. Hutchinson’s name was
not discovered by me till after the issue of volumes
<span class="smcapuc">I.</span> and <span class="smcapuc">II.</span> (which appeared simultaneously), and it was
first brought under my notice by Mr. Hutchinson’s
own letters to the newspapers. My debt to
Mr. Hutchinson is great; and, although I have already
thanked him for the services which he has rendered
to the world in connection with Wordsworthian literature,
I may perhaps be allowed to repeat the acknowledgment
now. The revised sheets of Vols. <span class="smcapuc">I.</span> and
<span class="smcapuc">II.</span> of this edition were, however, submitted to others at
the same time that they were sent to Mr. Hutchinson;
more especially to the late Mr. Dykes Campbell, and on
his death to Mr. Belinfante, and then to the late
Mr. Kinghorn, all of whom were engaged by my publishers
to assist in the work entrusted to me. They “turned
on the microscope” on my own work, and Mr.
Hutchinson’s; and to them I have been indebted in
many ways.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Hill’s services, in tracing the sources of numerous
quotations from other poets which occur in Wordsworth’s
text, have been great. He sent me his discoveries,
unsolicited, and I wish to express very cordially my
indebtedness to him. To discover some of these quotations&mdash;there
are several hundreds of them&mdash;cost me
much labour, before I had the pleasure of hearing from,
or knowing, Mr. Hill; and his assistance in this matter
has been greater than that of any other person. It will
be seen that I have failed&mdash;after much study and
extensive correspondence&mdash;to discover them all.</p>

<p>In addition to actual quotations&mdash;indicated by
Wordsworth by inverted commas in his poems&mdash;to trace
parallel passages from other poets, or phrases which
may have suggested to him what he recast and glorified,
has seemed to me work not unworthy of accomplishment.
At the same time, and in the same connection,
to discover the somewhat similar debts of later poets
to Wordsworth, and to indicate this here and there in
footnotes, may not be wholly useless to posterity.</p>

<p>My obligations to my friend, Mr. Dykes Campbell,
are greater than I can adequately express. He supplied
me with much material, drawn from many quarters;
and, although he did not always mention his sources, I
had implicit confidence in him, both as a literary man
and a friend. After his death, through the kindness
of Mrs. Campbell, I examined some MS. volumes of
<i>Wordsworthiana</i> written by him, which were of much
use to me.</p>

<p>Some of these were from unknown sources, which
I should perhaps have traced out before making use
of them, but, in all my Wordsworth work, I have acted
from first to last on the legal opinion of a distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
Judge, that the heir of the writer of literary work could
alone authorise its subsequent publication; and, since
the heirs of the Poet had kindly given me permission
to collect and publish his works, I did so, with a view
to the benefit of posterity.</p>

<p>Some of Mr. Campbell’s material was derived from
MSS. now in the possession of Mr. T. Norton Longman,
and I have to express my sincere regret that in the
earlier volumes I copied from Mr. Campbell’s transcripts
of these MSS.&mdash;which were lent to him on the condition
that no public use should be made of them without
Mr. Longman’s permission&mdash;some variations of the
text, without mentioning the source whence they were
derived.</p>

<p>I was unaware that these MSS. were lent to Mr. Campbell
with the condition attached, and regret very
much that I am unable to trust my memory to indicate
now what variations of text I have quoted from them.
But I may add that Mr. Longman is about to publish
a work which will enable Wordsworth students to
become practically acquainted with the contents of
his MSS.</p>

<p>In reference to the poems not published by Wordsworth
or his sister during their lifetime, I have included
in this volume not only fugitive pieces printed in
Magazines and elsewhere, but also those which have
been since recovered from numerous manuscript sources.
They are of varying merit. It would be interesting
to know, and to record in every instance, where these
manuscripts now are; but this is impossible. In many
cases the manuscripts have recently changed ownership.
I have obtained a sight of many of them, and
have been granted permission to transcribe them, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
the fortunate possessors of large autograph collections,
and also from dealers in autographs; but, after the
sale of manuscripts at public auction-rooms, it is, as a
rule, impossible to trace them.</p>

<p>In many cases the MS. variants which have been
published in previous volumes occur in copies of the
poems, transcribed by the Wordsworth household in
private letters to friends. I have occasionally indicated
this in footnotes; but, to have done so always would
have disfigured the pages, and frequently the notes
would have been longer than the text. To trace the
present possessors of the MSS. would be well-nigh impossible.
It is perhaps worth mentioning that in several
cases Wordsworth entered as “misprints” in future
editions, what some of his editors have considered “new
readings.” <i>E.g.</i> in <i>The Excursion</i>, book ix. l. 679,
“wild” demeanour, instead of “mild” demeanour.</p>

<p>On Nov. 4, 1893, Mr. Aubrey de Vere wrote to me&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I earnestly hope that, in your ‘monumental edition,’ you
will restore the <i>Ode, Intimations of Immortality</i>, to the place
which Wordsworth always assigned to it, that of the High
Altar of his poetic Cathedral; remitting Quillinan’s laureate
Ode on an unworthy, because ‘occasional,’ subject to an
Appendix, as a work that at the time of publication was attributed
to Wordsworth, but was written by another, though it
probably was seen by him, and had a line or two of his in it,
and corrections by him.</p>

<p>“This is certainly the truth; and I should think that he
probably himself told all that truth to the officials, when transmitting
the Ode; but that they concealed the circumstance;
and that Wordsworth, then profoundly depressed in spirits,
gave no more thought to the subject, and soon forgot all
about it.…</p>

<p class="center">“Yours very sincerely,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Aubrey de Vere</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span></p>

<p>It was in compliance with Mr. Aubrey de Vere’s
request that, in this edition, I departed, in a single
instance, from the chronological arrangement of the
poems.</p>

<p>It may not be too trivial a detail to mention that I
gladly gave permission to other editors of Wordsworth
to make use of any of the material which I discovered,
and brought together, in former editions; <i>e.g.</i> to Mr.
George, in Boston, for his edition of <i>The Prelude</i> (in
which, if the reader, or critic, compares my original
edition with his notes, he will see what Mr. George
has done); and to Professor Dowden, Trinity College,
Dublin, for his most admirable Aldine edition. For the
latter&mdash;which will always hold a high place in Wordsworth
literature&mdash;I placed everything asked from me at
the disposal of Mr. Dowden.</p>

<p>While these sheets are passing through the press,
Dr. Garnett, of the British Museum&mdash;one of the
kindest and ablest of bibliographers&mdash;has forwarded
to me a contribution, previously sent by him to
<i>The Academy</i>, and printed in its issue of January 2,
1897.</p>

<p>I have no means of knowing&mdash;or of ultimately
discovering&mdash;whether that sonnet, printed as Wordsworth’s,
is really his. Dr. Garnett says, in his letter to me,
“The verses were undoubtedly in Wordsworth’s hand”;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
and, he adds, “I think they should be preserved, because
they are Wordsworth’s, and as an additional proof
of his regard for Camoens, whom he enumerates elsewhere
among great sonnet-writers. I have added a
version of the quatrains, that the piece may be complete.
From the character of the handwriting, the lines would
seem to have been written down in old age; and I am
not quite certain of the word which I have transcribed
as ‘Austral.’”</p>

The picture, though it is somewhat thinly painted, has much
merit in tone and general effect: it is chiefly valuable, however,
from the sentiment that pervades it. The anecdote of the
saying of the monk in sight of Titian’s picture was told in this
house by Mr. Wilkie, and was, I believe, first communicated to
the public in this poem, the former portion of which I was
composing at the time. Southey heard the story from Miss
Hutchinson, and transferred it to the <i>Doctor</i>; but it is not
easy to explain how my friend Mr. Rogers, in a note subsequently
added to his <i>Italy</i>, was led to speak of the same remarkable
words having many years before been spoken in his hearing by
a monk or priest in front of a picture of the Last Supper,
placed over a Refectory-table in a convent at Padua.&mdash;I.F.]</p>

during that time my companions have dropt off, one after another&mdash;all who
were my seniors, all who were my contemporaries, and many, or most of

landscape painted by Gaspar Poussin. It is possible that every word of the
above verses, though similar in subject, might have been written had the
author been unacquainted with those beautiful effusions of poetic sentiment.
But, for his own satisfaction, he must be allowed thus publicly to acknowledge
the pleasure those two poems of his Friend have given him, and the
grateful influence they have upon his mind as often as he reads them, or
thinks of them.&mdash;W.W. 1835.</p>

ground, she espied, in the thick though leafless hedge, a bird’s
nest half-filled with snow. Out of this comfortless appearance
arose this Sonnet, which was, in fact, written without the least
reference to any individual object, but merely to prove to myself
that I could, if I thought fit, write in a strain that Poets have
been fond of. On the 14th of February in the same year, my
daughter, in a sportive mood, sent it as a Valentine, under a
fictitious name, to her cousin C.W.&mdash;I.F.]</p>

<h3>WRITTEN AFTER THE DEATH OF CHARLES
LAMB</h3>

<p>[Light will be thrown upon the tragic circumstance alluded
to in this poem when, after the death of Charles Lamb’s Sister,
his biographer, Mr. Sergeant Talfourd, shall be at liberty to
relate particulars which could not, at the time his Memoir was
written, be given to the public. Mary Lamb was ten years older
than her brother, and has survived him as long a time. Were
I to give way to my own feelings, I should dwell not only on
her genius and intellectual powers, but upon the delicacy and
refinement of manner which she maintained inviolable under
most trying circumstances. She was loved and honoured by
all her brother’s friends; and others, some of them strange
characters, whom his philanthropic peculiarities induced him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
countenance. The death of C. Lamb himself was doubtless
hastened by his sorrow for that of Coleridge, to whom he had
been attached from the time of their being school-fellows at
Christ’s Hospital. Lamb was a good Latin scholar, and
probably would have gone to college upon one of the school
foundations but for the impediment in his speech. Had such
been his lot, he would most likely have been preserved from the
indulgences of social humours and fancies which were often
injurious to himself, and causes of severe regret to his friends,
without really benefiting the object of his misapplied kindness.&mdash;I.F.]</p>

<p>In the edition of 1837, these lines had no title. They were
printed privately,&mdash;before their first appearance in that edition,&mdash;as
a small pamphlet of seven pages without title or heading.
A copy will be found in the fifth volume of the collection of
pamphlets, forming part of the library bequeathed by the late
Mr. John Forster to the South Kensington Museum. There
are several readings to be found only in this privately-printed
edition. The poem was placed among the “Epitaphs and
Elegiac Pieces.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<h3>EXTEMPORE EFFUSION UPON THE DEATH
OF JAMES HOGG</h3>

<p class="center">Composed 1835.&mdash;Published 1835</p>

<p>[These verses were written extempore, immediately after
reading a notice of the Ettrick Shepherd’s death, in the
Newcastle paper, to the Editor of which I sent a copy for
publication. The persons lamented in these verses were all
either of my friends or acquaintance. In Lockhart’s <i>Life of Sir
Walter Scott</i>, an account is given of my first meeting with
him in 1803. How the Ettrick Shepherd and I became known
to each other has already been mentioned in these notes. He
was undoubtedly a man of original genius, but of coarse manners
and low and offensive opinions. Of Coleridge and Lamb I
need not speak here. Crabbe I have met in London at Mr.
Rogers’s, but more frequently and favourably at Mr. Hoare’s
upon Hampstead Heath. Every spring he used to pay that
family a visit of some length, and was upon terms of intimate
friendship with Mrs. Hoare, and still more with her daughter-in-law,
who has a large collection of his letters addressed to
herself. After the Poet’s decease, application was made to her
to give up these letters to his biographer, that they, or at least
part of them, might be given to the public. She hesitated to
comply, and asked my opinion on the subject. “By no means,”
was my answer, grounded not upon any objection there might
be to publishing a selection from these letters, but from an
aversion I have always felt to meet idle curiosity by calling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
back the recently departed to become the object of trivial and
familiar gossip. Crabbe obviously for the most part preferred
the company of women to that of men, for this among other
reasons, that he did not like to be put upon the stretch in
general conversation: accordingly in miscellaneous society his
<i>talk</i> was so much below what might have been expected from a
man so deservedly celebrated, that to me it seemed trifling. It
must upon other occasions have been of a different character, as
I found in our rambles together on Hampstead Heath, and not
so much from a readiness to communicate his knowledge of life
and manners as of natural history in all its branches. His mind
was inquisitive, and he seems to have taken refuge from the
remembrance of the distresses he had gone through, in these
studies and the employments to which they led. Moreover,
such contemplations might tend profitably to counterbalance the
painful truths which he had collected from his intercourse with
mankind. Had I been more intimate with him, I should have
ventured to touch upon his office as a minister of the Gospel,
and how far his heart and soul were in it so as to make him
a zealous and diligent labourer: in poetry, though he wrote
much as we all know, he assuredly was not so. I happened
once to speak of pains as necessary to produce merit of a certain
kind which I highly valued: his observation was&mdash;“It is not
worth while.” You are quite right, thought I, if the labour
encroaches upon the time due to teach truth as a steward of the
mysteries of God: if there be cause to fear <i>that</i>, write less:
but, if poetry is to be produced at all, make what you do
produce as good as you can. Mr. Rogers once told me that he
expressed his regret to Crabbe that he wrote in his later works
so much less correctly than in his earlier. “Yes,” replied he,
“but then I had a reputation to make; now I can afford to
relax.” Whether it was from a modest estimate of his own
qualifications, or from causes less creditable, his motives for
writing verse and his hopes and aims were not so high as is to
be desired. After being silent for more than twenty years, he
again applied himself to poetry, upon the spur of applause he
received from the periodical publications of the day, as he
himself tells us in one of his prefaces. Is it not to be lamented
that a man who was so conversant with permanent truth,
and whose writings are so valuable an acquisition to our
country’s literature, should have <i>required</i> an impulse from such
a quarter? Mrs. Hemans was unfortunate as a poetess in being
obliged by circumstances to write for money, and that so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
frequently and so much, that she was compelled to look out
for subjects wherever she could find them, and to write as
expeditiously as possible. As a woman, she was to a considerable
degree a spoilt child of the world. She had been early in life
distinguished for talent, and poems of hers were published while
she was a girl. She had also been handsome in her youth, but
her education had been most unfortunate. She was totally
ignorant of housewifery, and could as easily have managed the
spear of Minerva as her needle. It was from observing these
deficiencies, that, one day while she was under my roof, I
<i>purposely</i> directed her attention to household economy, and
told her I had purchased <i>Scales</i> which I intended to present
to a young lady as a wedding present; pointed out their
utility (for her especial benefit) and said that no ménage
ought to be without them. Mrs. Hemans, not in the least
suspecting my drift, reported this saying, in a letter to a friend
at the time, as a proof of my simplicity. Being disposed to
make large allowances for the faults of her education and the
circumstances in which she was placed, I felt most kindly
disposed towards her, and took her part upon all occasions, and
I was not a little affected by learning that after she withdrew to
Ireland, a long and severe sickness raised her spirit as it
depressed her body. This I heard from her most intimate
friends, and there is striking evidence of it in a poem written
and published not long before her death. These notices of Mrs.
Hemans would be very unsatisfactory to her intimate friends, as
indeed they are to myself, not so much for what is said, but
what for brevity’s sake is left unsaid. Let it suffice to add,
there was much sympathy between us, and, if opportunity had
been allowed me to see more of her, I should have loved and
valued her accordingly; as it is, I remember her with true
affection for her amiable qualities, and, above all, for her
delicate and irreproachable conduct during her long separation
from an unfeeling husband, whom she had been led to marry
from the romantic notions of inexperienced youth. Upon this
husband I never heard her cast the least reproach, nor did I
ever hear her even name him, though she did not wholly
forbear to touch upon her domestic position; but never so that
any fault could be found with her manner of adverting to it.

<h3>UPON SEEING A COLOURED DRAWING OF
THE BIRD OF PARADISE IN AN ALBUM</h3>

<p class="center">Composed 1835.&mdash;Published 1836</p>

<p>[I cannot forbear to record that the last seven lines of this
Poem were composed in bed during the night of the day on
which my sister Sara Hutchinson died about 6 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, and it
was the thought of her innocent and beautiful life that, through
faith, prompted the words&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>The reader will find two poems on pictures of this bird among
my Poems. I will here observe that in a far greater number of
instances than have been mentioned in these notes one poem
has, as in this case, grown out of another, either because I felt
the subject had been inadequately treated, or that the thoughts
and images suggested in course of composition have been such
as I found interfered with the unity indispensable to every work
of art, however humble in character.&mdash;I.F.]</p>

23rd June 1836. It was after her that the poet named one of the two
“heath-clad rocks” referred to in the “Poems on the naming of Places,”
and which he called respectively “Mary-Point” and “Sarah-Point.” In
1827 he inscribed to her the sonnet beginning&mdash;</p>

<p>In a letter to Southey (unpublished), Wordsworth refers to her death, and
adds: “I saw her within an hour after her decease, in the silence and peace
of death, with as heavenly an expression on her countenance as ever human

myself, I can say that I have passed a wakeful night, more in joy than in
sorrow, with that blessed face before my eyes perpetually as I lay in bed.”</p>

<h3>MEMORIALS OF A TOUR IN ITALY
1837</h3>

<p class="center">Composed 1837.&mdash;Published 1842</p>

<p>[During my whole life I had felt a strong desire to visit
Rome and the other celebrated cities and regions of Italy, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
did not think myself justified in incurring the necessary expense
till I received from Mr. Moxon, the publisher of a large edition
of my poems, a sum sufficient to enable me to gratify my wish
without encroaching upon what I considered due to my family.
My excellent friend H.C. Robinson readily consented to
accompany me, and in March 1837, we set off from London,
to which we returned in August, earlier than my companion
wished or I should myself have desired had I been, like him, a
bachelor. These Memorials of that tour touch upon but a very
few of the places and objects that interested me, and, in what
they do advert to, are for the most part much slighter than I
could wish. More particularly do I regret that there is no
notice in them of the South of France, nor of the Roman
antiquities abounding in that district, especially of the Pont de
Degard, which, together with its situation, impressed me full
as much as any remains of Roman architecture to be found in
Italy. Then there was Vaucluse, with its Fountain, its
Petrarch, its rocks of all seasons, its small plots of lawn in
their first vernal freshness, and the blossoms of the peach and
other trees embellishing the scene on every side. The beauty
of the stream also called forcibly for the expression of sympathy
from one who, from his childhood, had studied the brooks and
torrents of his native mountains. Between two and three hours
did I run about climbing the steep and rugged crags from whose
base the water of Vaucluse breaks forth. “Has Laura’s
Lover,” often said I to myself, “ever sat down upon this stone?
or has his foot ever pressed that turf?” Some, especially of
the female sex, would have felt sure of it: my answer was
(impute it to my years) “I fear, not.” Is it not in fact obvious
that many of his love verses must have flowed, I do not say
from a wish to display his own talent, but from a habit of
exercising his intellect in that way rather than from an impulse
of his heart? It is otherwise with his Lyrical poems, and
particularly with the one upon the degradation of his country:
there he pours out his reproaches, lamentations, and aspirations
like an ardent and sincere patriot. But enough: it is time to
turn to my own effusions such as they are.&mdash;I.F.]</p>

<p>The Tour of which the following Poems are very inadequate
remembrances was shortened by report, too well founded, of
the prevalence of Cholera at Naples. To make some amends
for what was reluctantly left unseen in the South of Italy, we
visited the Tuscan Sanctuaries among the Apennines, and the
principal Italian Lakes among the Alps. Neither of those
lakes, nor of Venice, is there any notice in these Poems, chiefly
because I have touched upon them elsewhere. See, in particular,
<i>Descriptive Sketches</i>, “Memorials of a Tour on the
Continent in 1820,” and a Sonnet upon the extinction of the
Venetian Republic.&mdash;W.W.</p>

<p>Sir Humphry Davy was with us at the time. We had
ascended from Patterdale, and I could not but admire the
vigour with which Scott scrambled along that horn of the
mountain called “Striding Edge.” Our progress was necessarily
slow, and was beguiled by Scott’s telling many stories
and amusing anecdotes, as was his custom. Sir H. Davy
would have probably been better pleased if other topics had
occasionally been interspersed, and some discussion entered
upon: at all events he did not remain with us long at the top
of the mountain, but left us to find our way down its steep side
together into the Vale of Grasmere, where, at my cottage, Mrs.
Scott was to meet us at dinner.</p>

<p>This, though introduced here, I did not know till it was told
me at Rome by Miss Mackenzie of Seaforth, a lady whose
friendly attentions during my residence at Rome I have gratefully
acknowledged with expressions of sincere regret that she
is no more. Miss M. told me that she accompanied Sir
Walter to the Janicular Mount, and, after showing him the
grave of Tasso in the church upon the top, and a mural
monument, there erected to his memory, they left the church
and stood together on the brow of the hill overlooking the
City of Rome: his daughter Anne was with them, and she,
naturally desirous, for the sake of Miss Mackenzie especially,
to have some expression of pleasure from her father, half
reproached him for showing nothing of that kind either by his
looks or voice: “How can I,” replied he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span> “having only one
leg to stand upon, and that in extreme pain!” so that the
prophecy was more than fulfilled.</p>

<div class="verse">Over waves rough and deep.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We took boat near the lighthouse at the point of the right
horn of the bay which makes a sort of natural port for Genoa;
but the wind was high, and the waves long and rough, so that
I did not feel quite recompensed by the view of the city,
splendid as it was, for the danger apparently incurred. The
boatman (I had only one) encouraged me saying we were quite
safe, but I was not a little glad when we gained the shore,
though Shelley and Byron&mdash;one of them at least, who seemed
to have courted agitation from any quarter&mdash;would have probably
rejoiced in such a situation: more than once I believe
were they both in extreme danger even on the lake of Geneva.
Every man, however, has his fears of some kind or other; and
no doubt they had theirs: of all men whom I have ever known,
Coleridge had the most of passive courage in bodily peril, but
no one was so easily cowed when moral firmness was required
in miscellaneous conversation or in the daily intercourse of
social life.</p>

</div>

<p>There is not a single bay along this beautiful coast that might
not raise in a traveller a wish to take up his abode there, each
as it succeeds seems more inviting than the other; but the
desolated convent on the cliff in the bay of Savona struck my
fancy most; and had I, for the sake of my own health or that
of a dear friend, or any other cause, been desirous of a residence
abroad, I should have let my thoughts loose upon a
scheme of turning some part of this building into a habitation
provided as far as might be with English comforts. There is
close by it a row or avenue, I forget which, of tall cypresses.
I could not forbear saying to myself&mdash;“What a sweet family
walk, or one for lonely musings, would be found under the
shade!” but there, probably, the trees remained little noticed
and seldom enjoyed.</p>

<p>The broom is a great ornament through the months of March

own limited observations only, I cannot affirm the same of
several of their wild spring flowers, the primroses in particular,
which I saw not unfrequently but thinly scattered and languishing
compared to ours.</p>

was entrusted to my friend, Mr. Frederick Faber.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> I told him
what I wished to be said, and begged that, as he was intimately

in the moral temper which would elevate the present by doing reverence
to the past, I would draw cheerful auguries for the English Church from
this movement, as likely to restore among us a tone of piety more earnest
and real than that produced by the mere formalities of the understanding,
refusing, in a degree, which I cannot but lament, that its own temper and
judgment shall be controlled by those of antiquity.&mdash;W.W. 1842.</p>

<h4>II<br />
THE PINE OF MONTE MARIO<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> AT ROME</h4>

<p>[Sir George Beaumont told me that, when he first visited
Italy, pine-trees of this species abounded, but that on his
return thither, which was more than thirty years after, they had
disappeared from many places where he had been accustomed
to admire them, and had become rare all over the country,
especially in and about Rome. Several Roman villas have
within these few years passed into the hands of foreigners, who,
I observed with pleasure, have taken care to plant this tree,
which in course of years will become a great ornament to the
city and to the general landscape. May I venture to add
here, that having ascended the Monte Mario, I could not resist
embracing the trunk of this interesting monument of my
departed friend’s feelings for the beauties of nature, and the
power of that art which he loved so much, and in the practice
of which he was so distinguished?&mdash;I.F.]</p>

Pincio, the Pine tree as described in the sonnet; and, while expressing
admiration at the beauty of its appearance, I was told by an acquaintance
of my fellow-traveller, who happened to join us at the moment, that a price
had been paid for it by the late Sir G. Beaumont, upon condition that the
proprietor should not act upon his known intention of cutting it down.&mdash;W.W.

<h4>III<br />
AT ROME</h4>

<p>[Sight is at first sight a sad enemy to imagination and to
those pleasures belonging to old times with which some exertions
of that power will always mingle: nothing perhaps brings
this truth home to the feelings more than the city of Rome;
not so much in respect to the impression made at the moment
when it is first seen and looked at as a whole, for then the
imagination may be invigorated and the mind’s eye quickened;
but when particular spots or objects are sought out, disappointment
is I believe invariably felt. Ability to recover from this
disappointment will exist in proportion to knowledge, and the
power of the mind to reconstruct out of fragments and parts, and
to make details in the present subservient to more adequate
comprehension of the past.&mdash;I.F.]</p>

must be acknowledged; but, on the other hand, they who
reflect, while they see and observe, cannot but be struck with

<p><a name="Footnote_130" id="Footnote_130"></a><a href="#FNanchor_130"><span class="label">[130]</span></a> Laverna is a corruption of <i>Alverna</i> (now called Alverniac). It is about
five or six hours’ walk from Camaldoli, on a height of the Apennines, not far
from the sources of the Anio. To reach it, “the southern height of the
Monte Valterona is ascended as far as the chapel of St. Romaiald; then a
descent is made to Moggiona, beyond which the path turns to the left,
traversing a long and fatiguing succession of gorges and slopes; the path at
the base of the mountain is therefore preferable. The market town of Soci
in the valley of the Archiano is first reached, then the profound valley of the
Corsaline; beyond it rises a blunted cone, on which the path ascends in
windings to a stony plain with marshy meadows. Above this rises the
abrupt sandstone mass of the <i>Vernia</i>, to the height of 850 feet. On its
S.W. slope, one-third of the way up, and 3906 feet above the sea-level, is
seen a wall with small windows, the oldest part of the monastery, built in
1218 by St. Francis of Assisi. The church dates from 1284.… One of the
grandest points is the <i>Penna della Vernia</i> (4796 feet), the ridge of the
Vernia, also known as <i>l’Apennino</i>, the ‘rugged rock between the sources of
the Tiber and Anio,’ as it is called by Dante (<i>Paradiso</i>, ii. 106).… Near
the monastery are the <i>Luoghi Santi</i>, a number of grottos and rock-hewn
chambers in which St. Francis once lived.” (See Baedeker’s <i>Northern
Italy</i>, 1886, p. 463.)</p>

<p>“The Monte Alverno, or Monte della Verni is situated on the border of
Tuscany, near the sources of the Tiber and Anio, not far from the Castle
of Chiusi, where Orlando lived.” (Mrs. Oliphant’s <i>Francis of Assisi</i>, chap.
xvi. p. 248.)</p>

establishing numerous monasteries in Italy, Spain, and France, resigned his
office and retired to this, one of the highest of the Apennine heights. See
note, p. 67. He was canonised in 1230. Henry Crabb Robinson tells us,
“It was at Laverna that he” [W.W.] “led me to expect that he had found a
subject on which he could write, and that was the love which birds bore to
St. Francis. He repeated to me a short time afterwards a few lines, which
I do not recollect amongst those he has written on St. Francis in this poem.
On the journey, one night only I heard him in bed composing verses, and on
the following day I offered to be his amanuensis; but I was not patient
enough, I fear, and he did not employ me a second time. He made inquiries
for St. Francis’s biography, as if he would dub him his Leibheiliger
(body-saint), as Goethe (saying that every one must have one) declared St.
Philip Neri to be his.” (See the <i>Memoirs of William Wordsworth</i>, by his

<h4>XV<br />
AT THE CONVENT OF CAMALDOLI</h4>

<p>This famous sanctuary was the original establishment of Saint Romualdo
(or Rumwald, as our ancestors saxonised the name) in the 11th century, the
ground (campo) being given by a Count Maldo. The Camaldolensi, however,
have spread wide as a branch of Benedictines, and may therefore be
classed among the <i>gentlemen</i> of the monastic orders. The society comprehends
two orders, monks and hermits; symbolised by their arms, two doves
drinking out of the same cup. The monastery in which the monks here
reside is beautifully situated, but a large unattractive edifice, not unlike a
factory. The hermitage is placed in a loftier and wilder region of the forest.
It comprehends between 20 and 30 distinct residences, each including for its
single hermit an inclosed piece of ground and three very small apartments.
There are days of indulgence when the hermit may quit his cell, and when
old age arrives, he descends from the mountain and takes his abode among
the monks.</p>

<p>My companion had, in the year 1831, fallen in with the monk, the subject
of these two sonnets, who showed him his abode among the hermits. It is
from him that I received the following<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> particulars. He was then about 40
years of age, but his appearance was that of an older man. He had been a
painter by profession, but on taking orders changed his name from Santi to
Raffaello, perhaps with an unconscious reference as well to the great Sanzio
d’Urbino as to the archangel. He assured my friend that he had been 13
years in the hermitage and had never known melancholy or ennui. In the
little recess for study and prayer, there was a small collection of books. “I
read only,” said he, “books of asceticism and mystical theology.” On being
asked the names of the most famous<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> mystics, he enumerated <i>Scaramelli</i>,
<i>San Giovanni della Croce</i>, <i>St. Dionysius the Areopagite</i> (supposing the
work which bears his name to be really his),<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> and with peculiar emphasis
<i>Ricardo di San Vittori</i>. The works of <i>Saint Theresa</i> are also in high
repute among ascetics.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> These names may interest some of my readers.</p>

<p>We heard that Raffaello was then living in the convent; my friend sought
in vain to renew his acquaintance with him. It was probably a day of
seclusion. The reader will perceive that these sonnets were supposed to be
written when he was a young man.&mdash;W.W. 1842.</p>

<p>The monastery of Camaldoli is on the highest point of the hills near
Naples (1476 feet), and commands one of the finest views in Italy.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

hospitably entertained, I feel obliged to notice, that I saw among them no
other figures at all resembling, in size and complexion, the two Monks described
in this Sonnet. What was their office, or the motive which brought
them to this place of mortification, which they could not have approached
without being carried in this or some other way, a feeling of delicacy prevented
me from inquiring. An account has before been given of the
hermitage they were about to enter. It was visited by us towards the end
of the month of May; yet snow was lying thick under the pine-trees, within
a few yards of the gate.&mdash;W.W. 1842.</p>

<h4>XVIII<br />
AT VALLOMBROSA<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></h4>

<p>[I must confess, though of course I did not acknowledge it
in the few lines I wrote in the Strangers’ book kept at the
convent, that I was somewhat disappointed at Vallombrosa. I
had expected, as the name implies, a deep and narrow valley
overshadowed by enclosing hills; but the spot where the
convent stands is in fact not a valley at all, but a cove or
crescent open to an extensive prospect. In the book before
mentioned, I read the notice in the English language that if
anyone would ascend the steep ground above the convent, and
wander over it, he would be abundantly rewarded by magnificent
views. I had not time to act upon this recommendation,
and only went with my young guide to a point, nearly on a
level with the site of the convent, that overlooks the Vale of
Arno for some leagues. To praise great and good men has
ever been deemed one of the worthiest employments of poetry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
but the objects of admiration vary so much with time and
circumstances, and the noblest of mankind have been found,
when intimately known, to be of characters so imperfect, that
no eulogist can find a subject which he will venture upon with
the animation necessary to create sympathy, unless he confines
himself to a particular part or he takes something of a one-sided
view of the person he is disposed to celebrate. This is a
melancholy truth, and affords a strong reason for the poetic
mind being chiefly exercised in works of fiction: the poet can
then follow wherever the spirit of admiration leads him, unchecked
by such suggestions as will be too apt to cross his way
if all that he is prompted to utter is to be tested by fact.
Something in this spirit I have written in the note attached to
the Sonnet on the King of Sweden; and many will think that
in this poem and elsewhere I have spoken of the author of
<i>Paradise Lost</i> in a strain of panegyric scarcely justifiable by
the tenor of some of his opinions, whether theological or
political, and by the temper he carried into public affairs, in
which, unfortunately for his genius, he was so much concerned.&mdash;I.F.]</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_145" id="Footnote_145"></a><a href="#FNanchor_145"><span class="label">[145]</span></a> The name of Milton is pleasingly connected with Vallombrosa in many
ways. The pride with which the Monk, without any previous question
from me, pointed out his residence, I shall not readily forget. It may be
proper here to defend the Poet from a charge which has been brought
against him, in respect to the passage in <i>Paradise Lost</i>, where this place is
mentioned. It is said, that he has erred in speaking of the trees there
being deciduous, whereas they are, in fact, pines. The fault-finders are
themselves mistaken; the <i>natural</i> woods of the region of Vallombrosa <i>are</i>
deciduous, and spread to a great extent; those near the convent are, indeed,
mostly pines; but they are avenues of trees <i>planted</i> within a few steps of
each other, and thus composing large tracts of wood; plots of which are
periodically cut down. The appearance of those narrow avenues, upon
steep slopes open to the sky, on account of the height which the trees attain
by being <i>forced</i> to grow upwards, is often very impressive. My guide, a
boy of about fourteen years old, pointed this out to me in several places.&mdash;W.W.

<h4>XIX<br />
AT FLORENCE</h4>

<p>[Upon what evidence the belief rests that this stone was a
favourite seat of Dante, I do not know; but a man would
little consult his own interest as a traveller, if he should busy
himself with doubts as to the fact. The readiness with which
traditions of this character are received, and the fidelity with
which they are preserved from generation to generation, are an
evidence of feelings honourable to our nature. I remember
how, during one of my rambles in the course of a college
vacation, I was pleased on being shown a seat near a kind of
rocky cell at the source of the river, on which it was said that
Congreve wrote his <i>Old Bachelor</i>. One can scarcely hit on
any performance less in harmony with the scene; but it was a
local tribute paid to intellect by those who had not troubled
themselves to estimate the moral worth of that author’s comedies;
and why should they? He was a man distinguished in his day;
and the sequestered neighbourhood in which he often resided
was perhaps as proud of him as Florence of her Dante: it is
the same feeling, though proceeding from persons one cannot
bring together in this way without offering some apology to the
Shade of the great Visionary.&mdash;I.F.]</p>

who had spoken of his being in a sound sleep up to the moment
when one of his great battles was to be fought, as a proof of
the calmness of his mind and command over anxious thoughts&mdash;said
frankly, that he slept because from bodily exhaustion he
could not help it. In like manner it is noticed that criminals
on the night previous to their execution seldom awake before
they are called, a proof that the body is the master of us far
more than we need be willing to allow. Should this note by
any possible chance be seen by any of my countrymen who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>

are too recent to exhibit, in anything like an equal degree, the
beauty with which time and nature have invested the remains
of our Convents and Abbeys. These verses, it will be observed,
take up the beauty long before it is matured, as one cannot but
wish it may be among some of the desolations of Italy, France,

<h4>XXV<br />
AFTER LEAVING ITALY</h4>

<p>[I had proof in several instances that the Carbonari, if I may
still call them so, and their favourers, are opening their eyes to
the necessity of patience, and are intent upon spreading knowledge
actively but quietly as they can. May they have
resolution to continue in this course! for it is the only one by
which they can truly benefit their country. We left Italy by
the way which is called the “Nuova Strada de Allmagna,” to
the east of the high passes of the Alps, which take you at once
from Italy into Switzerland. This road leads across several
smaller heights, and winds down different vales in succession,
so that it was only by the accidental sound of a few German
words that I was aware we had quitted Italy, and hence the
unwelcome shock alluded to in the two or three last lines of
the latter sonnet.&mdash;I.F.]</p>

<h3>A NIGHT THOUGHT</h3>

<p class="center">Composed 1837.&mdash;Published 1837</p>

<p>[These verses were thrown off extempore upon leaving Mrs.
Luff’s house at Fox Ghyll one evening. The good woman is
not disposed to look at the bright side of things, and there
happened to be present certain ladies who had reached the
point of life where <i>youth</i> is ended, and who seemed to contend
with each other in expressing their dislike of the country and
climate. One of them had been heard to say she could not
endure a country where there was “neither sunshine nor
cavaliers.”&mdash;I.F.]</p>

<p>This poem was first published in <i>The Tribute, a Collection of
Miscellaneous unpublished Poems by various Authors, edited by
Lord Northampton</i>, in 1837, “for the benefit of the widow and
family of the Rev. Edward Smedley.” (The same volume
contained a poem by Southey on Brough Bells.) It next
found a place in “Poems chiefly of Early and Late Years”
(1842). A stanza given in <i>The Tribute</i>, No. 2 (see below),
was omitted afterwards.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>The fourteen “Sonnets upon the Punishment of Death”
were originally published in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> (in December
1841), in an article on the “Sonnets of William Wordsworth”
by the late Sir Henry Taylor, author of <i>Philip van Artevelde</i>,
and other poems. Towards the close of this article (of 1841),
after reviewing the volume of Sonnets published in 1838, Sir
Henry adds, “There is a short series <i>written two years ago</i>,
which we have been favoured with permission to present to the
public for the first time. It was suggested by the recent discussions
in Parliament, and elsewhere, on the subject of the
‘Punishment of Death.’”</p>

<p>When republishing this and other critical Essays on Poetry,
in the collected edition of his works in 1878, Sir Henry omitted
the paragraphs relating to these particular sonnets. Wordsworth
published the sonnets in his volume of “Poems chiefly
of Early and Late Years,” in 1842.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<h3>SONNETS UPON THE PUNISHMENT OF
DEATH<br />
IN SERIES</h3>

<p class="center">Composed 1839.&mdash;Published 1841</p>

<p>“In the session of 1836, a report by the Commissioners on
Criminal Law&mdash;of which the second part was on this subject (the Punishment
of Death)&mdash;was laid before Parliament. In the ensuing session this
was followed by papers presented to Parliament by her Majesty’s command,
and consisting of a correspondence between the Commissioners, Lord John
Russell, and Lord Denman. Upon the foundation afforded by these documents,
the bills of the 17th July 1837&mdash;(7th Gul. IV. and 1st Vict. cap. 84
to 89 and 91)&mdash;were brought in and passed. These acts removed the punishment
of death from about 200 offences, and left it applicable to high
treason,&mdash;murder and attempts at murder&mdash;rape&mdash;arson with danger to life&mdash;and
to piracies, burglaries, and robberies, when aggravated by cruelty and
violence.” (Sir Henry Taylor, <i>Quarterly Review</i>, Dec. 1841, p. 39.) Some
members of the House of Commons&mdash;Mr. Fitzroy Kelly, Mr. Ewart, and
others&mdash;desired a further limitation of the punishment of death to the crimes
of murder and treason only: and the question of the entire abolition of
capital punishment being virtually before the country, Wordsworth dealt
with it in the following series of sonnets.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

cruelties committed in many parts of America, by men making a law of their
own passions. A far more formidable, as being a more deliberate mischief,
has appeared among those States, which have lately broken faith with the
public creditor in a manner so infamous. I cannot, however, but look at
both evils under a similar relation to inherent good, and hope that the time
is not distant when our brethren of the West will wipe off this stain from
their name and nation.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Additional Note.</span></p>

<p>I am happy to add that this anticipation is already partly realised; and
that the reproach addressed to the Pennsylvanians is no longer applicable
to them. I trust that those other states to which it may yet apply will soon
follow the example now set them by Philadelphia, and redeem their credit
with the world.&mdash;W.W. 1850.</p>

<p>“This editorial note is on a fly-leaf at the end of the fifth volume of the
edition, which was completed only a short time before the Poet’s death.
It contains probably the last sentences composed by him for the press. It
was promptly added by him in consequence of a suggestion from me, that
the sonnet addressed “<i>To Pennsylvanians</i>” was no longer just&mdash;a fact which
is mentioned to shew that the fine sense of truth and justice which distinguish
his writings was active to the last.” (Note to Professor Reed’s American
Edition of 1851.)&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

of the Wordsworths, to make a miniature portrait of the poet on ivory,
which had been commissioned by Mr. Moon, the publisher, for the purpose
of engraving. An engraving of this portrait was published on the 6th of
August 1841. The original is now in America. I think she must have been
wrong in her memory of the year, which was 1840. Miss Gillies also told
me that the Wordsworths were so pleased with what she had done for Mr.
Moon that they wished a replica for themselves, with Mrs. Wordsworth
added. She painted this; and a copy of it, subsequently taken for Miss
Quillinan, was long in her possession at Loughrigg Holme. It now belongs
to Mr. Gordon Wordsworth. It is to the portrait of Mrs. Wordsworth that
this sonnet and the next refer.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<h3>POOR ROBIN<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></h3>

<p class="center">Composed March 1840.&mdash;Published 1842</p>

<p>[I often ask myself what will become of Rydal Mount after
our day. Will the old walls and steps remain in front of the
house and about the grounds, or will they be swept away with
all the beautiful mosses and ferns and wild geraniums and other
flowers which their rude construction suffered and encouraged
to grow among them?<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>&mdash;This little wild flower&mdash;“Poor Robin”&mdash;is
here constantly courting my attention, and exciting what
may be called a domestic interest with the varying aspects of
its stalks and leaves and flowers.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Strangely do the tastes of
men differ according to their employment and habits of life.
“What a nice well would that be,” said a labouring man to me
one day, “if all that rubbish was cleared off.” The “<i>rubbish</i>”
was some of the most beautiful mosses and lichens and ferns
and other wild growths that could possibly be seen. Defend
us from the tyranny of trimness and neatness showing itself in
this way! Chatterton says of freedom&mdash;“Upon her head wild
weeds were spread,” and depend upon it if “the marvellous
boy” had undertaken to give Flora a garland, he would have
preferred what we are apt to call weeds to garden flowers. True
taste has an eye for both. Weeds have been called flowers out
of place. I fear the place most people would assign to them
is too limited. Let them come near to our abodes, as surely
they may, without impropriety or disorder.&mdash;I.F.]</p>

Sept. 4, 1840:&mdash;“Hard at work. I heard from dear Wordsworth, with a
glorious sonnet on the Duke, and Copenhagen.† It is very fine, and I began
a new journal directly, and put in the sonnet. God bless him.” The following
is part of Wordsworth’s letter:&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Haydon</span>,&mdash;We are all charmed with your etching. It is both
poetically and pictorially conceived, and finely executed. I should have
written immediately to thank you for it, and for your letter and the enclosed
one, which is interesting, but I wished to gratify you by writing a sonnet.
I now send it, but with an earnest request that it may not be put into
circulation for some little time, as it is warm from the brain, and may require,
in consequence, some little retouching. It has this, at least, remarkable
attached to it, which will add to its value in your eyes, that it was actually

<h3>EPITAPH<br />
<span class="smcap">In the Chapel-yard of Langdale, Westmoreland</span></h3>

<p class="center">Composed 1841.&mdash;Published 1842</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Owen Lloyd</span>, the subject of this epitaph, was born at Old
Brathay, near Ambleside, and was the son of Charles Lloyd
and his wife Sophia (<i>née</i> Pemberton), both of Birmingham, who
came to reside in this part of the country, soon after their
marriage. They had many children, both sons and daughters,
of whom the most remarkable was the subject of this epitaph.
He was educated under Mr. Dawes, at Ambleside, Dr. Butler,
of Shrewsbury, and lastly at Trinity College, Cambridge, where
he would have been greatly distinguished as a scholar but for
inherited infirmities of bodily constitution, which, from early
childhood, affected his mind. His love for the neighbourhood
in which he was born, and his sympathy with the habits and
characters of the mountain yeomanry, in conjunction with
irregular spirits, that unfitted him for facing duties in situations
to which he was unaccustomed, induced him to accept the
retired curacy of Langdale. How much he was beloved and
honoured there, and with what feelings he discharged his duty
under the oppression of severe malady, is set forth, though
imperfectly, in the epitaph.&mdash;I.F.]</p>

<p>This commemorative epitaph to the Rev. Owen Lloyd&mdash;the
friend of Hartley Coleridge and of Faber&mdash;is carved on the headstone
over his grave in the churchyard at the small hamlet of
Chapel Stile, Great Langdale, Westmoreland. The stone also
carries the inscription, “To the memory of Owen Lloyd, M.A.,
nearly twelve years incumbent of this chapel. Born at Old
Brathay, March 31, 1803, died at Manchester, April 18, 1841,
aged 38.” See a letter of Wordsworth’s referring to Lloyd
amongst his letters in a subsequent volume. In a previous edition
I erred by giving this poem an earlier date. Professor Dowden
has shown the true one conclusively.</p>

<p>Writing from Rydal on 11th August 1841, to his brother
Christopher, Wordsworth said, “I send you with the last
corrections an epitaph which I have just written for poor Owen
Lloyd. His brother Edward forwarded for my perusal some
verses which he had composed with a view to that object; but
he expressed a wish that I would compose something myself.
Not approving Edward’s lines altogether, though the sentiments
were sufficiently appropriate, I sent him what I now forward to
you, or rather the substance of it, for something has been added,
and some change of expression introduced. I hope you will
approve of it. I find no fault with it myself, the circumstances
considered, except that it is too long for an Epitaph, but this
was inevitable if the memorial was to be as conspicuous as the
subject required, at least according to the light in which it
offered itself to my mind.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

to place this prelude, being too restricted in its bearing
to serve for a preface for the whole. The lines towards the
conclusion allude to the discontents then fomented through the
country by the agitators of the Anti-Corn-Law League: the
particular causes of such troubles are transitory, but disposition
to excite and liability to be excited are nevertheless permanent,
and therefore proper objects for the poet’s regard.&mdash;I.F.]</p>

<p>There is one of these floating islands in Loch Lomond in
Argyll, another in Loch Dochart in Perthshire, and another in
Loch Treig in Inverness. Their origin is probably due to a mass
of peat being detached from the shore, and floated out into the
lake. A mass of vegetable matter, however, has sometimes
risen from the bottom of the water, and assumed for a time all
the appearance of an island. This has been probably due to
an accumulation of gas, within or under the detached portion,
produced by the decay of vegetation in extremely hot weather.</p>

<p>Southey, in an unpublished letter to Sir George Beaumont
(10th July 1824), thus describes the Island at Derwentwater:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
“You will have seen by the papers that the Floating Island
has made its appearance. It sank again last week, when some
heavy rains had raised the lake four feet. By good fortune
Professor Sedgewick happened to be in Keswick, and examined
it in time. Where he probed it a thin layer of mud
lies upon a bed of peat, which is six feet thick, and this rests
upon a stratum of fine white clay,&mdash;the same I believe which
Miss Barker found in Borrowdale when building her unlucky
house. Where the gas is generated remains yet to be discovered,
but when the peat is filled with this gas, it separates
from the clay and becomes buoyant. There must have been a
considerable convulsion when this took place, for a rent was
made in the bottom of the lake, several feet in depth, and not
less than fifty yards long, on each side of which the bottom
rose and floated. It was a pretty sight to see the small fry
exploring this new made strait and darting at the bubbles which
rose as the Professor was probing the bank. The discharge of
air was considerable here, when a pole was thrust down. But at
some distance where the rent did not extend, the bottom had
been heaved up in a slight convexity, sloping equally in an
inclined plane all round: and there, when the pole was introduced,
a rush like a jet followed, as it was withdrawn. The
thing is the more curious, because as yet no example of it is
known to have been observed in any other place.”</p>

<p>Another of these detached islands used to float about in
Esthwaite Water, and was carried from side to side of the pool
at the north end of the lake&mdash;the same pool which the swans,
described in <i>The Prelude</i>, used to frequent. This island had a
few bushes on it: but it became stranded some time ago. One
of the old natives of Hawkeshead described the process of
trying to float it off again, by tying ropes to the bushes on its
surface,&mdash;an experiment which was unsuccessful. Compare
the reference to the Floating or “Buoyant” Island of Derwentwater,
and to the “mossy islet” of Esthwaite, in Wordsworth’s
<i>Guide through the District of the Lakes</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

not regret that I took the trouble, for not improbably the fact
is illustrative of the boy’s early piety, and may concur with my
other little pieces on children to produce profitable reflection
among my youthful readers. This is said, however, with an
absolute conviction that children will derive most benefit from
books which are not unworthy the perusal of persons of any
age. I protest with all my heart against those productions, so
abundant in the present day, in which the doings of children
are dwelt upon as if they were incapable of being interested in
anything else. On this subject I have dwelt at length in the

<div class="verse">Just as those final words were penned, the sun broke out in power,</div>
<div class="verse">And gladdened all things; but, as chanced, within that very hour,</div>
<div class="verse">Air blackened, thunder growled, fire flashed from clouds that hid the sky,</div>

<div class="verse">Me had the dream equipped with wings, so I took him in my arms,</div>

<div class="verse">I whispered, “Yet a little while, dear Child! thou art my own,</div>

worthy of attention as an Oak which may be seen in the ‘Pays de Caux,’
about a league from Yvetot, close to the church, and in the burial-ground of
Allonville.</p>

<p>The height of this Tree does not answer to its girth; the trunk, from the
roots to the summit, forms a complete cone; and the inside of this cone is
hollow throughout the whole of its height.</p>

<p>Such is the Oak of Allonville, in its state of nature. The hand of Man,
however, has endeavoured to impress upon it a character still more interesting,
by adding a religious feeling to the respect which its age naturally
inspires.</p>

<p>The lower part of its hollow trunk has been transformed into a Chapel of
six or seven feet in diameter, carefully wainscotted and paved, and an open
iron gate guards the humble Sanctuary.</p>

<p>Leading to it there is a staircase, which twists round the body of the
Tree. At certain seasons of the year divine service is performed in this
Chapel.</p>

<p>The summit has been broken off many years, but there is a surface at
the top of the trunk, of the diameter of a very large tree, and from it rises
a pointed roof, covered with slates, in the form of a steeple, which is
surmounted with an iron Cross, that rises in a picturesque manner from
the middle of the leaves, like an ancient Hermitage above the surrounding
Wood.</p>

<p>Over the entrance to the Chapel an Inscription appears, which informs us
it was erected by the Abbé du Détroit, Curate of Allonville, in the year
1696; and over a door is another, dedicating it ‘To Our Lady of Peace.’”&mdash;Vide

<h3>SUGGESTED BY A PICTURE OF THE BIRD
OF PARADISE</h3>

<p class="center">Published 1842</p>

<p>[This subject has been treated of in another note. I will
here only, by way of comment, direct attention to the fact, that
pictures of animals and other productions of Nature, as seen in
conservatories, menageries, and museums, etc., would do little for
the national mind, nay, they would be rather injurious to it, if
the imagination were excluded by the presence of the object,
more or less out of a state of Nature. If it were not that we
learn to talk and think of the lion and the eagle, the palm-tree,
and even the cedar, from the impassioned introduction of them
so frequently into Holy Scripture, and by great poets, and
divines who wrote as poets, the spiritual part of our nature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>

<h3>LOVE LIES BLEEDING</h3>

<p class="center">Composed 1842.&mdash;Published 1842</p>

<p>[It has been said that the English, though their country has
produced so many great poets, is now the most unpoetical nation
in Europe. It is probably true; for they have more temptation
to become so than any other European people. Trade, commerce,
and manufactures, physical science, and mechanic arts,
out of which so much wealth has arisen, have made our countrymen
infinitely less sensible to movements of imagination and
fancy than were our forefathers in their simple state of society.
How touching and beautiful were, in most instances, the names
they gave to our indigenous flowers, or any other they were
familiarly acquainted with!&mdash;Every month for many years have
we been importing plants and flowers from all quarters of the
globe, many of which are spread through our gardens, and some
perhaps likely to be met with on the few Commons which we
have left. Will their botanical names ever be displaced by
plain English appellations, which will bring them home to our
hearts by connexion with our joys and sorrows? It can never
be, unless society treads back her steps towards those simplicities
which have been banished by the undue influence of towns
spreading and spreading in every direction, so that city-life with
every generation takes more and more the lead of rural. Among
the ancients, villages were reckoned the seats of barbarism.
Refinement, for the most part false, increases the desire to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
accumulate wealth; and while theories of political economy are
boastfully pleading for the practice, inhumanity pervades all our
dealings in buying and selling. This selfishness wars against
disinterested imagination in all directions, and, evils coming
round in a circle, barbarism spreads in every quarter of our
island. Oh for the reign of justice, and then the humblest
man among us would have more power and dignity in and about
him than the highest have now!&mdash;I.F.]</p>

<p>I received, from the late Lord Coleridge, the following
extracts from letters written by Wordsworth to his father, the
Hon. Justice Coleridge, in reference to the Southey Inscription
in Crosthwaite Church. Wordsworth seems to have submitted
the proposed Inscription to Mr. Coleridge’s judgment, and the
changes he made upon it, in deference to the opinions he
received, shew, as Lord Coleridge says, “the extreme care
Wordsworth took to have the substance, and the expression also,
as perfect as he could make it.” The original draft of the
“Inscription” was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>I quite agree with you that the construction of the lines that
particularize his writings is rendered awkward by so many
participles passive, and the more so on account of the transitive
verb <i>informed</i>. One of these participles may be got rid of,

<p>I do not feel with you in respect to the word “so”; it
refers, of course, to the preceding line, and as the reference is
to fireside feelings and intimate friends, there appears to me a
propriety in an expression inclining to the colloquial. The
couplet was the dictate of my own feelings, and the construction
is accordingly broken and rather dramatic,&mdash;but too much of
this. If you have any objection to the couplet as altered, be
so kind as let me know; if not, on no account trouble yourself
to answer this letter.</p>

<p><i>Prematurely</i> I object to as you do. I used the word with
reference to that decay of faculties which is not uncommon in
advanced life, and which often leads to dotage,&mdash;but the word

<p>The first line would certainly have more spirit by
reading “your” as you suggest. I had previously considered
<i>that</i>; but decided in favour of “the,” as “your,” I thought,
would clog the sentence in sound, there being “ye” thrice
repeated, and followed by “<i>you</i>” at the close of the 4th line.
I also thought that “<i>your</i>” would interfere with the application
of “you” at the end of the fourth line, to the <i>whole</i> of the
particular previous images as I intended it to do. But I don’t
trouble you with this Letter on that account, but merely to ask
you whether the couplet now standing:&mdash;</p>

The word “<i>nest</i>” both in itself and in conjunction with
“<i>holier</i>” seems to me somewhat bold and rather startling for
marble, particularly in a Church. I should not have thought
of any alteration in a merely printed poem, but this makes a
difference. If you think the proposed alteration better, don’t
trouble yourself to answer this; if not, pray be so kind as to
tell me so by a single line. I would not on any account have
trespassed on your time but for this public occasion. We are

poem is from the <i>Memoir</i> of Professor Archer Butler, by Mr. Woodward,
prefixed to the “First Series” of his Sermons. The late Rev.
Archdeacon Graves, of Dublin (in 1849 of Windermere), in writing to Mr.
Woodward, gives an interesting account of a walk, in July 1844, from
Windermere, by Rydal and Grasmere, to Loughrigg Tarn, etc., in which
Butler was accompanied by Wordsworth, Julius Charles Hare, Sir William
Hamilton, etc. He says, “The day was additionally memorable as giving
birth to an interesting minor poem of Mr. Wordsworth’s. When we
reached the side of Loughrigg Tarn (which you may remember he notes for
its similarity, in the peculiar character of its beauty, to the Lago di Nemi&mdash;Dianae
Speculum), the loveliness of the scene arrested our steps and fixed
our gaze. The splendour of a July noon surrounded us and lit up the
landscape, with the Langdale Pikes soaring above, and the bright tarn
shining beneath; and when the poet’s eyes were satisfied with their feast on
the beauties familiar to them, they sought relief in the search, to them a
happy vital habit, for new beauty in the flower-enamelled turf at his feet.
There his attention was arrested by a fair smooth stone, of the size of an
ostrich’s egg, seeming to imbed at its centre, and at the same time to display
a dark star-shaped fossil of most distinct outline. Upon closer inspection
this proved to be the shadow of a daisy projected upon it with extraordinary
precision by the intense light of an almost vertical sun. The poet drew the
attention of the rest of the party to the minute but beautiful phenomenon,
and gave expression at the time to thoughts suggested by it, which so
interested our friend Professor Butler, that he plucked the tiny flower, and,
saying that “it should be not only the theme but the memorial of the
thought they had heard,” bestowed it somewhere carefully for preservation.
The little poem, in which some of these thoughts were afterwards crystallised,
commences with the stanza&mdash;</p>

north wall. In the Belfry and in the Chapter House, it is the same. The
“tower,” referred to in the sonnet, is evidently the belfry tower to the west.
It is still “grass-crowned.” The sonnet was doubtless composed on the spot,
and if Wordsworth ascended to the top of the belfry tower, he might have
seen the morning sunlight strike the small remaining fragment of the central
tower. But it is more likely that he looked up from the nave, or choir, of
the church to the belfry, when he spoke of the sun’s first smile gleaming from
the top of the tall tower. “Flowers”&mdash;crowfoot, campanulas, etc.&mdash;still
luxuriate on the mouldered walls. With the line,</p>

to Rydal, after it leaves the former lake and turns eastwards towards the
latter. They are still “heath-clad,” and covered with the coppice of the old
Bane Riggs Wood, so named because the shortest road from Ambleside to
Grasmere used to pass through it; “bain” or “bane” signifying, in the
Westmoreland dialect, a short cut. Dr. Cradock wrote of them thus:&mdash;“They
are now difficult of approach, being enclosed in a wood, with dense
undergrowth, and surrounded by a high, well-built wall. They can be well
seen from the lower road, from a spot close to the three-mile stone from
Ambleside. They are some fifty or sixty feet above the road, about twenty
yards apart, and separated by a slight depression of, say, ten feet. The
view from the easterly one is now much preferable, as it is less encumbered
with shrubs; and for that reason also is more heath-clad. The twin rocks
are also well seen, though at a farther distance, from the hill in White Moss
Common between the roads, which Dr. Arnold used to call ‘Old Corruption,’
and ‘Bit-by-bit Reform.’ Doubtless the rocks were far more easily
approached fifty years ago, when walls, if any, were low and ill-built. It is
probable, however, that even then they were enclosed and protected; for
heath will not grow on the Grasmere hills, on places much frequented by
sheep.” The best view of these “heath-clad” rocks from the lower carriage
road is at a spot two or three yards to the west of a large rock on the
road-side near the milestone. The view of them from the Loughrigg Terrace
walks is also interesting. The two sisters were Mary and Sarah Hutchinson
(Mrs. Wordsworth and her Sister); and, in the Rydal household, the rocks
were respectively named “Mary-Point,” and “Sarah-Point.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

Grasmere. She married a man named Davis, and died in 1872 at Broughton
in Furness. The swollen “flood” from which she rescued the lamb, was
Wyke Gill beck, which descends from the centre of Silver Howe. The
picturesque cottage, with round chimney,&mdash;a yew tree and Scotch fir behind
it,&mdash;is on the western side of the road from Grasmere over to Langdale by
Red Bank. The Mackereths have been a well-known Westmoreland family
for some hundred years. They belong to the “gentry of the soil,” and have
been parish clerks in Grasmere for generations. One of them was the tenant
of the Swan Inn referred to in <i>The Waggoner</i>&mdash;the host who painted, with
his own hand, the “famous swan,” used as a sign. (See vol. iii. p. 81.)</p>

<p>The story of <i>The Blind Highland Boy</i>, which gave rise to the poem
bearing that name, was told to Wordsworth by one of these Mackereths of
Grasmere. (See the Fenwick note, vol. ii. p. 420.) In a letter to Professor
Henry Reed (31st July 1845) Wordsworth said this poem might interest him
“as exhibiting what sort of characters our mountains breed. It is truth to
the letter.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

the Sonnet <i>To the Pennsylvanians</i>, in regard to which you inquire, I think
refer to what at the time Wordsworth wrote was known as the <i>repudiation</i>
by Pennsylvania of her State debt. The language, however, is too strong,
inasmuch as there was <i>no</i> repudiation. For a year or two the <i>interest</i> on
the debt was unpaid, then payment was resumed. Members of Wordsworth’s
family, or his near friends, held, I believe, some of the Pennsylvania
bonds. They held also, as appears from the <i>Memoirs</i>, Mississippi bonds,
and these <i>were</i> repudiated, or at least five million dollars of a certain class
of Mississippi bonds. No such wrong-doing is chargeable to Pennsylvania.
I remember the delight with which Professor Reed showed me the note on
the fly-leaf at the end of the fifth volume of the edition of 1850&mdash;words
written at his request, and the last sentences ever composed by the Poet for
the press.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

“<i>Jan. 23, 1846.</i> … Our daughter-in-law fell into bad health between
three and four years ago. She went with her husband to Madeira, where
they remained nearly a year; she was then advised to go to Italy. After
a prolonged residence there, her six children (whom her husband returned
to England for), went, at her earnest request, to that country, under their
father’s guidance; then he was obliged, on account of his duty as a clergyman,
to leave them. Four of the number resided with their mother at
Rome, three of whom took a fever there, of which the youngest&mdash;as noble a
boy of five years as ever was seen&mdash;died, being seized with convulsions when
the fever was somewhat subdued.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

disciple of Spagnaletto, next of Pietro da Cortona; but after coming under
the influence of Correggio, he went to Venice, where Titian was his inspiring
master. In his own work the influence of all of these predecessors may be
traced, but chiefly that of Titian, whose style of colouring and composition
he followed so closely that many of his works might be mistaken for those of
his greatest master. The picture referred to in this sonnet was brought from
Italy by the poet’s eldest son.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<h3>ODE<br />
INTIMATIONS OF IMMORTALITY FROM RECOLLECTIONS
OF EARLY CHILDHOOD</h3>

<p class="center">Composed 1803-6.&mdash;Published 1807</p>

<p>[This was composed during my residence at Town-end,
Grasmere. Two years at least passed between the writing of
the four first stanzas and the remaining part. To the attentive
and competent reader the whole sufficiently explains itself; but
there may be no harm in adverting here to particular feelings
or <i>experiences</i> of my own mind on which the structure of the
poem partly rests. Nothing was more difficult for me in childhood
than to admit the notion of death as a state applicable to
my own being. I have said elsewhere&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent7">A simple child,</div>
<div class="verse">That lightly draws its breath,</div>
<div class="verse">And feels its life in every limb,</div>
<div class="verse">What should it know of death!&mdash;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But it was not so much from feelings of animal vivacity that
my difficulty came as from a sense of the indomitableness of the
Spirit within me. I used to brood over the stories of Enoch
and Elijah, and almost to persuade myself that, whatever might
become of others, I should be translated, in something of the
same way, to heaven. With a feeling congenial to this, I was
often unable to think of external things as having external
existence, and I communed with all that I saw as something
not apart from, but inherent in, my own immaterial nature.
Many times while going to school have I grasped at a wall or
tree to recall myself from this abyss of idealism to the reality.
At that time I was afraid of such processes. In later periods
of life I have deplored, as we have all reason to do, a subjugation
of an opposite character, and have rejoiced over the
remembrances, as is expressed in the lines&mdash;</p>

<p>To that dream-like vividness and splendour which invest objects
of sight in childhood, every one, I believe, if he would look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
back, could bear testimony, and I need not dwell upon it here;
but having in the poem regarded it as presumptive evidence of
a prior state of existence, I think it right to protest against a
conclusion, which has given pain to some good and pious
persons, that I meant to inculcate such a belief. It is far too
shadowy a notion to be recommended to faith, as more than
an element in our instincts of immortality. But let us bear in
mind that, though the idea is not advanced in revelation, there
is nothing there to contradict it, and the fall of man presents
an analogy in its favour. Accordingly, a pre-existent state has
entered into the popular creeds of many nations; and, among
all persons acquainted with classic literature, is known as an
ingredient in Platonic philosophy. Archimedes said that he
could move the world if he had a point whereon to rest his
machine. Who has not felt the same aspirations as regards the
world of his own mind?<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> Having to wield some of its elements
when I was impelled to write this poem on the “Immortality
of the Soul,” I took hold of the notion of pre-existence as having
sufficient foundation in humanity for authorizing me to make for
my purpose the best use of it I could as a poet.&mdash;I.F.]</p>

<p>This great <i>Ode</i> was first printed as the last poem in the second
volume of the edition of 1807. At that date Wordsworth gave
it the simple title <i>Ode</i>, prefixing to it the motto, “Paulò majora
canamus.” In 1815, when he revised the poem throughout,
he named it&mdash;in the characteristic manner of many of his titles&mdash;diffuse
and yet precise, <i>Ode. Intimations of Immortality
from Recollections of Early Childhood</i>; and he then prefixed to
it the lines of his own earlier poem on the Rainbow (March
1802):&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">The Child is Father of the Man;</div>
<div class="verse">And I could wish my days to be</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It retained this longer title and motto in all subsequent editions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
In the editions 1807 to 1820, it was placed by itself at
the end of the poems, and formed their natural conclusion and
climax. In the editions 1827 and 1832, it was inappropriately
put amongst “Epitaphs and Elegiac Poems.” The evident
mistake of placing it amongst these seems to have suggested
to Wordsworth, in 1836, its having a place by itself,&mdash;which
he gave it then and retained in the subsequent editions of 1842
and 1849,&mdash;when it closed the series of minor poems in Volume
<span class="smcapuc">V.</span>, and preceded the <i>Excursion</i> in Volume <span class="smcapuc">VI.</span> The same
arrangement was adopted in the double-columned single volume
edition of 1845.</p>

<p>Mr. Aubrey de Vere has urged me to take it out of its
chronological place, and let it conclude the whole series of
Wordsworth’s poems, as the greatest, and that to which all
others lead up. Mr. De Vere’s wish is based on conversations
which he had with the poet himself.</p>

<p>The <i>Ode, Intimations of Immortality</i>, was written at intervals,
between the years 1803 and 1806; and it was subjected to frequent
and careful revision. No poem of Wordsworth’s bears
more evident traces in its structure at once of inspiration and
elaboration; of original flight of thought and <i>afflatus</i> on the one
hand, and on the other of careful sculpture and fastidious choice
of phrase. But it is remarkable that there are very few changes
of text in the successive editions. Most of the alterations were
made before 1815, and the omission of some feeble lines which
originally stood in stanza viii. in the editions of 1807 and 1815,
was a great advantage in disencumbering the poem. The main
revision and elaboration of this Ode, however&mdash;an elaboration
which suggests the passage of the glacier ice over the rocks of
White Moss Common, where the poem was murmured out
stanza by stanza&mdash;was all finished before it first saw the light
in 1807. In form it is irregular and original. And perhaps
the most remarkable thing in its structure, is the frequent
change of the keynote, and the skill and delicacy with which
the transitions are made. “The feet throughout are iambic.
The lines vary in length from the Alexandrine to the line with
two accents. There is a constant ebb and flow in the full tide
of song, but scarce two waves are alike.” (Hawes Turner,
<i>Selections from Wordsworth</i>.)</p>

<p>In the “notes” to the <i>Selections</i> just referred to on Immortality,
there is an excellent commentary on this <i>Ode</i>, almost every
line of which is worthy of minute analysis and study. Some
of the following are suggested by Mr. Turner’s notes.</p>

<p>This thought Wordsworth owed, consciously or unconsciously,
to Plato. Though he tells us in the Fenwick note that he did
not mean to <i>inculcate</i> the belief, there is no doubt that he clung
to the notion of a life pre-existing the present, on grounds
similar to those on which he believed in a life to come. But
there are some differences in the way in which the idea
commended itself to Plato and to Wordsworth. The stress was
laid by Wordsworth on the effect of terrestrial life in putting
the higher faculties to sleep, and making us “forget the glories
we have known.” Plato, on the other hand, looked upon the
mingled experiences of mundane life as inducing a gradual but
slow remembrance (ἀνάμνεσις) of the past. Compare Tennyson’s
<i>Two Voices</i>, and Wordsworth’s sonnet, beginning&mdash;</p>

<p>The outward sensible universe, visible and tangible, seeming
to fall away from us, as unreal, to vanish in unsubstantially.
See the explanation of this youthful experience in the Fenwick
note. That confession of his boyish days at Hawkshead,
“many times, while going to school, have I grasped at a wall
or tree, <i>to recall myself from this abyss of idealism to the reality</i>”
(by which he explains those&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Fallings from us, vanishings, etc.),</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">suggests a similar experience and confession of Cardinal Newman’s
in his <i>Apologia</i> (see p. 67).</p>

<p>The late Rev. Robert Perceval Graves, of Windermere, and
afterwards of Dublin, wrote to me in 1850:&mdash;“I remember Mr.
Wordsworth saying, that at a particular stage of his mental
progress, he used to be frequently so rapt into an unreal transcendental
world of ideas that the external world seemed no
longer to exist in relation to him, and he <i>had to reconvince
himself of its existence by clasping a tree, or something that happened
to be near him</i>. I could not help connecting this fact with that
obscure passage in his great <i>Ode on the Intimations of
Immortality</i>, in which he speaks of&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent2">Those obstinate questionings</div>
<div class="verse">Of sense and outward things;</div>
<div class="verse">Fallings from us, vanishings; etc.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Professor Bonamy Price further confirms the explanation
which Wordsworth gave of the passage, in a letter written to
me in 1881, giving an account of a conversation he had with
the poet, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Oxford</span>, <i>April 21, 1881</i>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;You will be glad, I am sure, to receive
an interpretation, which chance enabled me to obtain from
Wordsworth himself of a passage in the immortal <i>Ode on
Immortality</i>.…</p>

<p>“It happened one day that the poet, my wife, and I were
taking a walk together by the side of Rydal Water. We were
then by the sycamores under Nab Scar. The aged poet was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
a most genial mood, and it suddenly occurred to me that I
might, without unwarrantable presumption, seize the golden
opportunity thus offered, and ask him to explain these mysterious
words. So I addressed him with an apology, and begged him
to explain, what my own feeble mother-wit was unable to unravel,
and for which I had in vain sought the assistance of others,
what were those ‘fallings from us, vanishings,’ for which,
above all other things, he gave God thanks. The venerable
old man raised his aged form erect; he was walking in the
middle, and passed across me to a five-barred gate in the wall
which bounded the road on the side of the lake. He clenched
the top bar firmly with his right hand, pushed strongly against
it, and then uttered these ever-memorable words: ‘There was
a time in my life when I had to push against something that
resisted, to be sure that there was anything outside of me. I
was sure of my own mind; everything else fell away, and
vanished into thought.’ Thought, he was sure of; matter for
him, at the moment, was an unreality&mdash;nothing but a thought.
Such natural spontaneous idealism has probably never been felt
by any other man.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Bonamy Price.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>This, however, was not an experience peculiar to Wordsworth,
as Professor Price imagined&mdash;and its value would be
much lessened if it had been so&mdash;but was one to which (as the
poet said to Miss Fenwick) “every one, if he would look back,
could bear testimony.”</p>

<p>The following is from S.T. Coleridge’s <i>Biographia Literaria</i>
(chap. xxii. p. 29, edition 1817)&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>“To the <i>Ode on the Intimations of Immortality from
Recollections of Early Childhood</i>, the poet might have prefixed
the lines which Dante addresses to one of his own
Canzoni&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Canzone, i’ credo, che saranno radi</div>

<div class="verse">Who may thy import understand aright:</div>
<div class="verse">Thou art for them so arduous and so high!</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the Ode was intended for such readers only as had been
accustomed to watch the flux and reflux of their inmost nature,
to venture at times into the twilight realms of consciousness,
and to feel a deep interest in modes of inmost being, to which
they know that the attributes of time and space are inapplicable
and alien, but which yet cannot be conveyed, save in symbols
of time and space. For such readers the sense is sufficiently
plain, and they will be as little disposed to charge Mr. Wordsworth
with believing the Platonic pre-existence in the ordinary
interpretation of the words, as I am to believe, that Plato
himself ever meant or taught it.</p>

<p>“ … There was never yet the child of any promise (so
far as the theoretic faculties are concerned) but awaked to the
sense of beauty with the first gleam of reason; and I suppose
there are few, among those who love Nature otherwise than by
profession and at second-hand, who look not back to their
youngest and least learned days as those of the most intense,
superstitious, insatiable, and beatific perception of her splendours.
And the bitter decline of this glorious feeling, though many
note it not, partly owing to the cares and weight of manhood,
which leave them not the time nor the liberty to look for their
lost treasure, and partly to the human and divine affections
which are appointed to take its place, yet have formed the
subject, not indeed of lamentation, but of holy thankfulness for
the witness it bears to the immortal origin and end of our
nature, to one whose authority is almost without appeal in all
questions relating to the influence of external things upon the
pure human soul.</p>

<p>And if it were possible for us to recollect all the unaccountable
and happy instincts of the careless time, and to reason upon
them with the maturer judgment, we might arrive at more
right results than either the philosophy or the sophisticated
practice of art has yet attained. But we love the perceptions
before we are capable of methodising or comparing them.”

<p>The extent of Wordsworth’s debt to Vaughan has been
discussed a good deal. There was no copy of the <i>Silex
Scintillans</i> in the Rydal Mount sale-catalogue. I believe that
he had read <i>The Retreate</i>, and forgotten it more completely
perhaps than Coleridge forgot Sir John Davies’ <i>Orchestra, a
Poem on Dancing</i>, when he wrote <i>The Ancient Mariner</i>.</p>

<p>The following may be added from <i>The Friend</i> (the edition
of 1818), vol. i. p. 183:&mdash;“To find no contradiction in the
union of old and new to contemplate the Ancient of Days
with feelings as fresh as if they then sprang forth at his own
fiat, this characterizes the minds that feel the riddle of the
world, and may help to unravel it! To carry on the feelings
of childhood into the powers of manhood, to combine the
child’s sense of wonder and novelty with the appearances which
every day, for perhaps 40 years, had rendered familiar,</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_337" id="Footnote_337"></a><a href="#FNanchor_337"><span class="label">[337]</span></a> The only justification for republishing this sonnet is that it is the earliest
authoritative record of Wordsworth’s attempts in Verse. It is a much more
authentic one than the <i>Extract from the conclusion of a Poem, composed in
anticipation of leaving School</i>, or than the lines <i>Written in very early
Youth</i>, and beginning</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Calm is all nature as a resting wheel.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Wordsworth dated the former of these poems 1786, but I do not believe that
he wrote that poem, and still less that he wrote “Calm is all nature,” etc.,
<i>as we now have it</i>, in that year. Doubtless he wrote verses on these two
subjects; but the best evidence against the notion that the text, as we now
have it, was written in 1786, is this 1787 sonnet on Miss Maria Williams.
It is not only dated authoritatively, but it was <i>published</i> in 1787; and therefore
serves (as nothing else can until we come to 1793) as evidence in regard
to the development of his poetic power. The translation of Francis
Wrangham’s lines&mdash;which he called <i>The Birth of Love</i>&mdash;in 1795, is further
evidence in the same direction. No doubt there were many poor poetic
utterances by Wordsworth later in life&mdash;failures in his manhood, as dismal as
the “Walford Tragedy” was in his youth&mdash;but I think that the <i>Lines

<h3>LINES WRITTEN BY WILLIAM WORDSWORTH
AS A SCHOOL EXERCISE AT HAWKSHEAD,
ANNO ÆTATIS 14</h3>

<p>In the “Autobiographical Memoranda”&mdash;dictated at Rydal
Mount in 1847&mdash;Wordsworth said, “The first verses which I
wrote were a task imposed by my master: the subject <i>The
Summer Vacation</i>, and of my own accord I added others upon
<i>Return to School</i>. There was nothing remarkable in either
poem; but I was called upon, among other scholars, to write
verses upon the completion of the second century from the
foundation of the school in 1585, by Archbishop Sandys.
These verses were much admired, far more than they deserved,
for they were but a tame imitation of Pope’s versification, and a
little in his style. This exercise, however, put it into my head
to compose verses from the impulse of my own mind; and I
wrote, while yet a schoolboy, a long poem running upon my
own adventures, and the scenery of the county in which I was
brought up.”</p>

<p>The <i>Summer Vacation</i>, and the <i>Return to School</i>, were
destroyed by Wordsworth.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<h3>“SWEET WAS THE WALK ALONG THE
NARROW LANE”</h3>

<p>This sonnet is found in one of Dorothy Wordsworth’s letters
to her friend Miss Jane Polland, written from Forncett Rectory,
on 6th May 1792. She wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“I promised to transcribe some of William’s compositions.
As I made the promise I will give you a little sonnet, but all
the same I charge you, as you value our friendship, not to read
it, or to show it to any one&mdash;to your sister, or any other person.…
I take the first that offers. It is only valuable to me
because the lane which gave birth to it was the favourite evening
walk of my dear William and me.” … “I have not chosen
this sonnet because of any particular beauty it has; it was the
first I laid my hands upon.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Sweet was the walk along the narrow lane</div>
<div class="verse">At noon, the bank and hedgerows all the way</div>
<div class="verse">Shagged with wild pale green tufts of fragrant hay,</div>
<div class="verse">Caught by the hawthorns from the loaded wain</div>
<div class="verse">Which Age, with many a slow stoop, strove to gain; <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
<div class="verse">And Childhood seeming still more busy, took</div>
<div class="verse">His little rake with cunning sidelong look,</div>

<div class="verse">Quiet and dark; for through the thick-wove trees</div>

<h3>“THERE IS A SHAPELESS CROWD OF
UNHEWN STONES”</h3>

<p>Numerous fragments of verse, more or less unfinished, occur
in the Grasmere Journals, written by Dorothy Wordsworth.
One of these&mdash;which is broken up into irregular fragments,
and very incomplete&mdash;is evidently part of the material which
was written about the old Cumbrian shepherd Michael. The
successive alterations of the text of the poem <i>Michael</i> are in the
Grasmere Journal. These fragments have a special topographical
interest, from their description of Helvellyn, and its
spring, the fountain of the mists, and the stones on the summit.
On the outside leather cover of the MS. book there is written,
“May to Dec. 1802.”</p>

<p>The following lines come first:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">There is a shapeless crowd of unhewn stones<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></div>
<div class="verse">That lie together, some in heaps, and some</div>
<div class="verse">In lines, that seem to keep themselves alive</div>
<div class="verse">In the last dotage of a dying form.</div>
<div class="verse">At least so seems it to a man who stands</div>
<div class="verse">In such a lonely place.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These are followed by a few lines, some of which were afterwards
used in <i>The Prelude</i> (see vol. iii. p. 269):&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">To one identity, by differences</div>
<div class="verse">That have no law, no meaning, and no end,</div>
<div class="verse">Shall he feel yearning to those lifeless forms,</div>
<div class="verse">And shall we think that Nature is less kind</div>
<div class="verse">To those, who all day long, through a long life,</div>
<div class="verse">Have walked within her sight? It cannot be.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>

<div class="verse">Sat. Eve., 20 past 6, May 29.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Other fragments follow, less worthy of preservation. Then
the passage, which occurs in book xiii. of <i>The Prelude</i>,
beginning&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">There are who think that strong affection, love,</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">(see vol. iii. p. 361), with one or two variations from the
final text, which were not improvements.</p>

<p>Five lines on Helvellyn, afterwards included in the <i>Musings
near Aquapendente</i> (see vol. viii. p. 47, ll. 61-65), come next.</p>

<p>The fragments referring to <i>Michael</i> are written down,
probably just as the brother dictated them to his sister, and
would be&mdash;if not unintelligible&mdash;certainly without any literary
connection or unity, were they printed in the order in which
they occur. I therefore transpose them slightly, to give something
like continuity to the whole; which remains, of course,
a torso.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I will relate a tale for those who love</div>
<div class="verse">To lie beside the lonely mountain brooks,</div>

<div class="verse">…</div>
<div class="verse indent16">… It befell</div>
<div class="verse">At the first falling of the autumnal snows,</div>
<div class="verse">Old Michael and his son one day went forth</div>
<div class="verse">In search of a stray sheep. It was the time</div>
<div class="verse">When from the heights our shepherds drive their flocks</div>
<div class="verse">To gather all their mountain family</div>
<div class="verse">Into the homestalls, ere they send them back</div>
<div class="verse">There to defend themselves the winter long.</div>
<div class="verse">Old Michael for this purpose had driven down</div>
<div class="verse">His flock into the vale, but as it chanced,</div>
<div class="verse">A single sheep was wanting. They had sought</div>
<div class="verse">The straggler during all the previous day</div>
<div class="verse">All over their own pastures, and beyond.</div>
<div class="verse">And now at sunrise, sallying forth again</div>
<div class="verse">Far did they go that morning: with their search</div>
<div class="verse">Beginning towards the south, where from Dove Crag</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
<div class="verse">(Ill home for bird so gentle), they looked down</div>
<div class="verse">On Deep-dale-head, and Brothers water (named</div>
<div class="verse">From those two Brothers that were drowned therein);</div>
<div class="verse">Thence northward did they pass by Arthur’s seat,<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></div>
<div class="verse">And Fairfield’s highest summit, on the right</div>
<div class="verse">Leaving St. Sunday’s Crag, to Grisdale tarn</div>
<div class="verse">They shot, and over that cloud-loving hill,</div>
<div class="verse">Seat-Sandal, a fond lover of the clouds;</div>
<div class="verse">Thence up Helvellyn, a superior mount,</div>
<div class="verse">With prospect underneath of Striding edge,</div>
<div class="verse">And Grisdale’s houseless vale, along the brink</div>
<div class="verse">Of Sheep-cot-cove, and those two other coves,</div>
<div class="verse">Huge skeletons of crags which from the coast</div>
<div class="verse">Of old Helvellyn spread their arms abroad</div>
<div class="verse">And make a stormy harbour for the winds.</div>
<div class="verse">Far went these shepherds in their devious quest,</div>
<div class="verse">From mountain ridges peeping as they passed</div>
<div class="verse">Down into every nook; …</div>
<div class="verse indent11">… and many a sheep</div>
<div class="verse">On height or bottom<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> did they see, in flocks</div>
<div class="verse">Or single. And although it needs must seem</div>
<div class="verse">Hard to believe, yet could they well discern</div>
<div class="verse">Even at the utmost distance of two miles</div>
<div class="verse">(Such strength of vision to the shepherd’s eye</div>
<div class="verse">Doth practice give) that neither in the flocks</div>
<div class="verse">Nor in the single sheep was what they sought.</div>
<div class="verse">So to Helvellyn’s eastern side they went,</div>
<div class="verse">Down looking on that hollow, where the pool</div>
<div class="verse">Of Thirlmere flashes like a warrior’s shield</div>
<div class="verse">His light high up among the gloomy rocks,</div>
<div class="verse">With sight of now and then a straggling gleam</div>
<div class="verse">On Armath’s<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> pleasant fields. And now they came,</div>
<div class="verse">To that high spring which bears no human name,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
<div class="verse">As one unknown by others, aptly called</div>
<div class="verse">The fountain of the mists. The father stooped</div>
<div class="verse">To drink of the clear water, laid himself</div>
<div class="verse">Flat on the ground, even as a boy might do,</div>
<div class="verse">To drink of the cold well. When in like sort</div>
<div class="verse">His son had drunk, the old man said to him</div>
<div class="verse">That now he might be proud, for he that day</div>
<div class="verse">Had slaked his thirst out of a famous well,</div>
<div class="verse">The highest fountain known on British land.</div>
<div class="verse">Thence, journeying on a second time, they passed</div>
<div class="verse">Those small flat stones, which, ranged by traveller’s hands</div>
<div class="verse">In cyphers on Helvellyn’s highest ridge,</div>
<div class="verse">Lie loose on the bare turf, some half-o’ergrown</div>
<div class="verse">By the grey moss, but not a single stone</div>
<div class="verse">Unsettled by a wanton blow from foot</div>
<div class="verse">Of shepherd, man or boy. They have respect</div>
<div class="verse">For strangers who have travelled far perhaps,</div>
<div class="verse">For men who in such places, feeling there</div>
<div class="verse">The grandeur of the earth, have left inscribed</div>
<div class="verse">Their epitaph, which rain and snow</div>
<div class="verse">And the strong wind have reverenced.</div>
<div class="verse">…</div>
<div class="verse indent1">But soon as Luke, full ten years old, could stand</div>
<div class="verse">Against the mountain blasts, and to the heights</div>
<div class="verse">Not fearing toil, nor length of weary ways,</div>
<div class="verse">He with his Father daily went, and they</div>
<div class="verse">Were as companions, why should I relate</div>
<div class="verse">That objects which the shepherd lov’d before</div>

<div class="verse">Feelings and emanations, things which were</div>
<div class="verse">Light to the sun and music to the wind;</div>
<div class="verse">And that the old man’s heart seem’d born again?</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Thus in his Father’s sight the Boy grew up;</div>
<div class="verse">And now when he had reached his eighteenth year,</div>
<div class="verse">He was his comfort and his daily hope.</div>

<div class="verse">Whole hours with but small interchange of speech,</div>

<div class="verse indent12">… At length the boy</div>
<div class="verse">Said, “Father, ’tis lost labour; with your leave</div>
<div class="verse">I will go back and range a second time</div>
<div class="verse">The grounds which we have hunted through before.”</div>
<div class="verse">So saying, homeward, down the hill the boy</div>
<div class="verse">Sprang like a gust of wind: [and with a heart</div>
<div class="verse">Brimful of glory said within himself,</div>
<div class="verse">“I know where I shall find him, though the storm</div>
<div class="verse">Have driven him twenty miles.”</div>
<div class="verse">For ye must know]<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> that though the storm</div>
<div class="verse">Drive one of those poor creatures miles and miles,</div>
<div class="verse">If he can crawl, he will return again</div>
<div class="verse">To his own hills, the spots where when a lamb</div>
<div class="verse">He learned to pasture at his mother’s side.</div>
<div class="verse">Bethinking him of this, again the boy</div>
<div class="verse">Pursued his way toward a brook, whose course</div>
<div class="verse">Was through that unfenced tract of mountain ground</div>
<div class="verse">Which to his father’s little farm belonged,</div>
<div class="verse">The home and ancient birthright of their flock.</div>
<div class="verse">Down the deep channel of the stream he went,</div>
<div class="verse">Prying through every nook. Meanwhile the rain</div>
<div class="verse">Began to fall upon the mountain tops,</div>
<div class="verse">Thick storm, and heavy, which for three hours’ space</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Abated not; and all that time the boy</div>
<div class="verse">Was busy in his search, until at length</div>
<div class="verse">He spied the sheep upon a plot of grass,</div>
<div class="verse">An island in the brook. It was a place</div>
<div class="verse">Remote and deep, piled round with rocks, where foot</div>
<div class="verse">Of man or beast was seldom used to tread.</div>
<div class="verse">But now, when everywhere the summer grass</div>
<div class="verse">Began to fail, this sheep by hunger pressed</div>
<div class="verse">Had left his fellows, made his way alone</div>
<div class="verse">To the green plot of pasture in the brook.</div>
<div class="verse">Before the boy knew well what he had seen</div>
<div class="verse">He leapt upon the island, with proud heart,</div>
<div class="verse">And with a shepherd’s joy. Immediately</div>
<div class="verse">The sheep sprang forward to the further shore,</div>
<div class="verse">And was borne headlong by the roaring flood.</div>
<div class="verse">At this the boy looked round him, and his heart</div>
<div class="verse">Fainted with fear. Thrice did he turn his face</div>
<div class="verse">To either bank, nor could he summon up</div>
<div class="verse">The courage that was needful to leap back</div>
<div class="verse">’Cross the tempestuous torrent; so he stood</div>
<div class="verse">A prisoner on the island, not without</div>
<div class="verse">More than one thought of death, and his last hour.</div>
<div class="verse">Meantime the father had returned alone</div>
<div class="verse">To his own home, and now at the approach</div>
<div class="verse">Of evening he went forth to meet his son,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor could he guess the cause for which the boy</div>
<div class="verse">Had stayed so long. The shepherd took his way</div>
<div class="verse">Up his own mountain grounds, where, as he walked</div>
<div class="verse">Along the steep that overhung the brook,</div>
<div class="verse">He seemed to hear a voice, which was again</div>
<div class="verse">Repeated, like the whistling of a kite.</div>
<div class="verse">At this, not knowing why&mdash;as often-times</div>
<div class="verse">The old man afterwards was heard to say&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Down to the brook he went, and tracked its course</div>
<div class="verse">Upwards among the o’erhanging rocks; nor</div>
<div class="verse">Had he gone far ere he espied the boy</div>
<div class="verse">Right in the middle of the roaring stream.</div>
<div class="verse">Without distress or fear the shepherd heard</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
<div class="verse">The outcry of his son: he stretched his staff</div>
<div class="verse">Towards him, bade him leap, which word scarce said</div>

<h3>“AMONG ALL LOVELY THINGS MY LOVE
HAD BEEN”</h3>

<p class="center">Composed April 12, 1802.&mdash;Published 1807</p>

<p>This poem&mdash;known in the Wordsworth household as <i>The
Glowworm</i>&mdash;was written on the 12th of April 1802, during a
ride from Middleham to Barnard Castle, and was published in
the edition of 1807. It was never reproduced. The “Lucy”
of this and other poems was his sister Dorothy. In a letter to
Coleridge, written in April 1802, he thus refers to the poem,
and to the incident which gave rise to it:&mdash;“I parted from
M&mdash;&mdash; on Monday afternoon, about six o’clock, a little on this
side Rushyford. Soon after I missed my road in the midst of
the storm.… Between the beginning of Lord Darlington’s park
at Raby, and two or three miles beyond Staindrop, I composed
the poem the opposite page. I reached Barnard Castle
about half-past ten.… The incident of this poem took
place about seven years ago between my sister and me.”</p>

<p>I think it probable that the “incident” occurred near
Racedown, Dorsetshire, where, in the autumn of 1795 Wordsworth
settled with his sister. The following is Dorothy’s
account of the composition of the poem:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>“Tuesday, April
20, 1802.&mdash;We sate in the orchard and repeated <i>The Glowworm</i>,
and other poems. Just when William came to a well,
or trough, which there is in Lord Darlington’s park, he began
to write that poem of <i>The Glowworm</i>; interrupted in going
through the town of Staindrop, finished it about two miles and
a-half beyond Staindrop. He did not feel the jogging of the
horse while he was writing; but, when he had done, he felt
the effect of it.… So much for <i>The Glowworm</i>. It
was written coming from Middleham, on Monday, April 12,
1802.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>I cannot affirm, with any certainty, that these lines were

in thinking that they were. He showed them to his relative&mdash;the
late Chief Justice&mdash;who said that he did not know who else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>

<h3>HOME AT GRASMERE</h3>

<p>The canto of Wordsworth’s autobiographical poem, unpublished
in <i>The Prelude</i> (1851), and first given to the world
in 1888, is appropriately entitled “Home at Grasmere.”</p>

<p>The introduction to <i>The Recluse</i> was not only kept back by
him during his lifetime, but was omitted by his representatives&mdash;with
what must be regarded as true critical insight&mdash;when
<i>The Prelude</i> was published in 1850. As a whole, it is not
equal to <i>The Prelude</i>. Certain passages are very inferior, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
there are others that posterity must cherish, and “not willingly
let die.” It was probably a conviction of its inequality and
inferiority that led Wordsworth to give only one or two selected
extracts from this canto to the world, in his own lifetime. Two
passages were printed in his <i>Guide to the District of the Lakes</i>;
another&mdash;a description of the flight and movement of birds&mdash;was
published in 1827, and subsequent editions, under the title
of <i>Water-Fowl</i>; while the Bishop of Lincoln published other
two passages in the <i>Memoirs</i> of his uncle, beginning respectively&mdash;</p>

<p>Internal evidence (see the numerous allusions to Dorothy,
and the reference to John Wordsworth) shows that this canto
of <i>The Recluse</i> was written at Grasmere, not long after Wordsworth’s
arrival there, and certainly before his marriage. The
text, as now printed, has been carefully compared with the
original MS. by Mr. Gordon Wordsworth. The MS. heading

<h3>“SHALL HE WHO GIVES HIS DAYS TO LOW
PURSUITS”</h3>

<p>The following lines occur in the experimental efforts made
by Wordsworth to write an autobiographical poem. They
occur in one of his sister’s Journals, entitled “May to December,
1802”; and were probably either dictated to her in that
year, or were copied by her from some earlier fragment. They
stand related to passages in <i>The Prelude</i>. (See vol. iii. p.
269.)&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<h3>“I FIND IT WRITTEN OF SIMONIDES”</h3>

<p class="center">Published in <i>The Morning Post</i>, October 10, 1803</p>

<p>S.T.C. writing to Tom Poole, October 14, 1803, said that
Wordsworth wrote to <i>The Morning Post</i> “as W. L. D., and
sometimes with no signature.” There is ample evidence that
the following sonnet was written by Wordsworth. He had
contributed five sonnets to <i>The Morning Post</i> before the month
of September 1803; and on the 10th of October in that year
the following appeared.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

Clarkson, September-November 1805. It was composed by

<h3>MICHAEL ANGELO IN REPLY TO THE
PASSAGE UPON HIS STATUE OF NIGHT
SLEEPING</h3>

<p>In the first volume of a copy of the edition of 1836,&mdash;long
kept by Wordsworth at Rydal Mount, and afterwards the
property of the late Lord Coleridge&mdash;which has been referred
to in the Preface to Vol. 1., and very often in the footnotes to
all the volumes, signed C.&mdash;Wordsworth wrote in MS. two
translations of a fragment of Michael Angelo’s on Sleep, and a
translation of some Latin verses by Thomas Warton on the
same subject. These fragments were never included in any
edition of his published works, and it is impossible to say to
what year they belong. From their close relation to other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
translations from Michael Angelo, made by Wordsworth in
1806, I assign them, conjecturally, to the same year. The

<h3>“BROOK, THAT HAST BEEN MY SOLACE
DAYS AND WEEKS”</h3>

<p>The following version of the sonnet beginning “Brook!
whose society the Poet seeks,” probably written in 1806 and
first published in 1815 (see vol. iv. p. 52), has come to light
since that volume was issued. The variants throughout are
sufficient to warrant its publication here. Had I received it
earlier they would have appeared in vol. iv.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<h3>GEORGE AND SARAH GREEN</h3>

<p class="center">Composed 1808.&mdash;Published 1839</p>

<p>This poem was first printed in De Quincey’s “Recollections
of Grasmere,” which appeared in <i>Tait’s Edinburgh Magazine</i>,
September 1839, p. 573, and afterwards in his <i>Recollections of
the Lakes</i> (1853), p. 23.</p>

<p>The text is printed as it is found in De Quincey’s article.
Doubtless Wordsworth, or some member of the family, had
supplied him with a copy of these verses. Wordsworth himself
seemed to have thought them unworthy of publication. A
copy of the poem was transcribed at Grasmere by Dorothy
Wordsworth for Lady Beaumont on the 20th April 1808. In
this copy there are numerous variations from the text as
published by De Quincey, and these are indicated in the
footnotes. In the letter to Lady Beaumont, Dorothy Wordsworth
says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span> “I am going to transcribe a poem composed by
my brother a few days after his return. It was begun in the
churchyard when he was looking at the grave of the Husband
and Wife, and is in fact supposed to be entirely composed
there.”</p>

<p>Wordsworth returned to his old home at Dove Cottage,
Grasmere, after a short visit to London, on the 6th April 1808;
and there he remained, till Allan Bank was ready for occupation.
I therefore conclude that this poem was written in
April 1808.</p>

<p>Compare De Quincey’s account of the disaster that befell
the Greens, as reported in his <i>Early Recollections of Grasmere</i>.
The Wordsworths had evidently taken part in the effort to
raise subscriptions in behalf of the orphan children. They
issued a printed appeal on the subject. The following is an
extract from a letter of Dorothy Wordsworth’s to Lady
Beaumont on the subject:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Grasmere</span>, <i>April 20th, 1808</i>.</p>

<p>“We received your letter this morning, enclosing the half of
a £5 note. I am happy to inform you that the orphans have
been fixed under the care of very respectable people. The
baby is with its sister&mdash;she who filled the Mother’s place in the
house during their two days of fearless solitude. It has clung
to her ever since, and she has been its sole nurse. I went
with two ladies of the Committee (in my sister’s place, who
was then confined to poor John’s bedside) to conduct the family
to their separate homes. The two Girls are together, as I
have said; two Boys at another Home; and the third Boy by
himself at the house of an elderly man who had a particular
friendship for their father. The kind reception that the
children met with was very affecting.”</p>

Wordsworth to Richard Sharpe, Esq., Mark Lane, London,
in a subsequent volume, referring to the catastrophe.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed</span>.</p>

<h3>“THROUGH CUMBRIAN WILDS, IN MANY A
MOUNTAIN COVE”</h3>

<p>In 1819 Wordsworth wrote the sonnet beginning, “Grief,
thou hast lost an ever ready friend.” In the note to that
sonnet (vol. vi. p. 196) I have given a different version of its last

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This sonnet was published in the first edition of the
Memorials of this Tour (1822), but was struck out of the next
edition, and never republished. Its rejection by Wordsworth
is curious.</p>

<p>It refers to the pedestrian tour which the Poet took, with his
friend Jones, in 1790, which he afterwards recorded in full in
his <i>Descriptive Sketches</i>.</p>

<p>Dorothy Wordsworth, in her Journal of the Tour in 1820,
refers to it thus:&mdash;“Our journey through the narrower and
most romantic passages of the Vale of the Rhine was connected
with times long past, when my brother and his Friend (it was
thirty years ago) floated down the stream in their little Bark.
Often did my fancy place them with a freight of happiness in
the centre of some bending reach, overlooked by tower or castle,
or (when expectation would be most eager) at the turning of a
promontory, which had concealed from their view some delicious
winding which we had left behind; but no more of my own
feelings, a record of his will be more interesting.”</p>

<p>She then quotes the sonnet, beginning</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The confidence of Youth our only Art.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There are also numerous allusions in Mrs. Wordsworth’s
Journal to this early tour; <i>e.g.</i> under date August 13. “We
left Meyringen; soon reached a sort of Hotel, which Wm.
pointed out to us with great interest, as being the only spot
where he and his friend Jones were ill used, during the course
of their adventurous journey&mdash;a wild looking building, a little
removed from the road, where the vale of Hasli ends.” Again,
in describing the sunset from the woody hill Colline de Gibet,
overlooking the two lakes of Brienz and Thun, at Interlaken,
“with the loveliest of green vallies between us and Jungfrau,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
“Surely William must have had this Paradise in his thoughts
when he began his <i>Descriptive Sketches</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Were there, below, a spot of holy ground,</div>
<div class="verse">By Pain and her sad family unfound, etc.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But no habitation was there among these rocky knolls, and tiny
pastures. One fragment, something like a ruined convent,
lurked under a steep, woody-fringed crag. What a Refuge for
a pious Sisterhood!” Compare also the note to <i>Stanzas composed
in the Simplon Pass</i>, vol. vi. p. 359.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<h3>“THESE VALES WERE SADDENED WITH NO COMMON GLOOM”</h3>

<p>In the <i>Memoirs of William Wordsworth</i> by his nephew (the
late Bishop of Lincoln) vol. i. chap. xxx. the following occurs as
an addendum transferred to the footnotes:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The first six lines of an epitaph in Grasmere Church were
also his composition. The elegant marble tablet on which they
were engraved was designed by Sir Francis Chantry, and
prepared by Allan Cunningham, 1822. It is over the chancel
door.”</p>

<p>The following is the Inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">In the Burial Ground<br />
of this Church are deposited the remains of<br />
<span class="smcap">Jemima Anne Deborah</span>,<br />

<h3>TRANSLATION OF PART OF THE FIRST
BOOK OF THE ÆNEID</h3>

<p class="center">Composed 1823 (?).&mdash;Published 1836</p>

<p>This translation was included in the <i>Philological Museum</i>,
edited by Julius Charles Hare, and published at Cambridge in
1832 (vol. i. p. 382, etc.). Three Books were translated by
Wordsworth, but the greater portion is still in MS., unpublished.
What is now reproduced appeared in the <i>Museum</i>. As it was
never included by Wordsworth himself in any edition of his Works,
his own estimate of its literary value was slight. It was published
by Professor Henry Reed in his American reprint of 1851.
Writing to Lord Lonsdale on 9th Nov. 1823, Wordsworth says,
“I have just finished a Translation into English rhyme of the
First <i>Æneid</i>. Would you allow me to send it to you? I
would be much gratified if you would take the trouble of
comparing some passages with the original. I have endeavoured
to be much more literal than Dryden, or Pitt&mdash;who keeps more
close to the original than his predecessor.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">TO THE EDITORS OF THE “PHILOLOGICAL
MUSEUM”</p>

<p>Your letter, reminding me of an expectation I some time since
held out to you of allowing some specimens of my translation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
from the <i>Æneid</i> to be printed in the <i>Philological Museum</i> was
not very acceptable; for I had abandoned the thought of ever
sending into the world any part of that experiment,&mdash;for it was
nothing more,&mdash;an experiment begun for amusement, and I
now think a less fortunate one than when I first named it to
you. Having been displeased in modern translations with the
additions of incongruous matter, I began to translate with a
resolve to keep clear of that fault, by adding nothing; but I
became convinced that a spirited translation can scarcely be
accomplished in the English language without admitting a
principle of compensation. On this point, however, I do not
wish to insist, and merely send the following passage, taken at
random, from a wish to comply with your request.&mdash;W.W.</p>

<h3>COMPOSED WHEN A PROBABILITY EXISTED
OF OUR BEING OBLIGED TO QUIT RYDAL
MOUNT AS A RESIDENCE</h3>

<p>The following lines were written by Wordsworth in 1826.
He never published them. They were the result of a slight
disagreement between the Wordsworth family and the Le
Flemings, which led the former to fear that they might have to
“quit Rydal Mount as a residence.” It was an insignificant
difference, and the Wordsworths did not leave their home.
The only thing worthy of record, in connection with the matter,
is that the fear of being dispossessed led the poet to write what
follows.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<h3>“MY LORD AND LADY DARLINGTON”</h3>

<p>These lines were written by Wordsworth, after reading a
sentence in the Stranger’s Book at “The Station,”&mdash;not a railway
station!&mdash;on the western side of Windermere lake, opposite
Bowness. Their poetic merit is slight, but they illustrate the
honesty and directness of the writer’s mind. The Stranger’s
Book at “The Station” contained the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Lord and Lady Darlington, Lady Vane, Miss Taylor, and
Captain Stamp pronounce this Lake superior to Lac de Genève,

<h3>“THRONED IN THE SUN’S DESCENDING
CAR”</h3>

<p>These lines were placed by Wordsworth amongst the
“Evening Voluntaries” in the two editions of <i>Yarrow Revisited
and other Poems</i> (1835, 1836); but they were never
afterwards reprinted in his life-time.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<p>For printing the following Piece, some reason should be
given, as not a word of it is original: it is simply a fine stanza
of Akenside,<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> connected with a still finer from Beattie<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>by a
couplet of Thomson.<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> This practice, in which the author
sometimes indulges, of linking together, in his own mind,
favourite passages from different authors, seemed in itself unobjectionable;
but, as the <i>publishing</i> such compilations might
lead to confusion in literature, he should deem himself inexcusable
in giving this specimen, were it not from a hope that it
might open to others a harmless source of <i>private</i> gratification.&mdash;W.

writes:&mdash;“‘<i>Protest against the Ballot.</i>’ Having in this notice alluded only
in general terms to the mischief which, in my opinion, the Ballot would
bring along with it, without especially branding its immoral and antisocial
tendency (for which no political advantages, were they a thousand times
greater than those presumed upon, could be a compensation), I have been
impelled to subjoin a reprobation of it upon that score. In no part of my
writings have I mentioned the name of any contemporary, that of Buonaparte
only excepted, but for the purpose of eulogy; and therefore, as in the
concluding verse of what follows, there is a deviation from this rule (for the
blank will be easily filled up) I have excluded the sonnet from the body of
the collection, and placed it here as a public record of my detestation, both
as a man and a citizen, of the proposed contrivance.”</p>

<p>Wordsworth’s lines on Grace Darling were printed privately,
and anonymously, at Carlisle, before they were included in the
1845 edition of his works. A copy was sent to Mr. Dyce, and
is preserved in the Dyce Library at South Kensington.
Another was sent to Professor Reed (March 27, 1843), with a
letter, in which the following occurs: “I threw it off two or three
weeks ago, being in a great measure impelled to it by the desire
I felt to do justice to the memory of a heroine, whose conduct
presented, some time ago, a striking contrast to the inhumanity
with which our countrymen, shipwrecked lately upon the French
coast, have been treated.”</p>

<p>Edward Quillinan, writing on 25th March 1843, enclosed a
copy, adding, “Mr. Wordsworth desires me to send you the
enclosed eulogy on Grace Darling, recently composed. He
begs me to say that he wishes it kept out of the newspapers, as
he has printed it only for some of his friends, and his friends’
friends more peculiarly interested in the subject, for the present.
Do not therefore give a copy to any one.”</p>

<p>“Almost immediately after I had composed my tribute to
the memory of Grace Darling, I learnt that the Queen and
Queen Dowager had both just subscribed towards the erection
of a monument to record her heroism, upon the spot that
witnessed it.” (Wordsworth to Sir W. Gomm, March 24,
1843.)&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

hut which he built with his own hands, on one of the Farne Islands. He
was afterwards induced to accept the bishopric of Hexham, but soon exchanged
it for the see in his old island home at Lindisfarne, and after two
years there resigned his bishopric, returning to his cell in Farne Island, where

<h3>“WHEN SEVERN’S SWEEPING FLOOD HAD
OVERTHROWN”</h3>

<p class="center">Composed 23rd January 1842.&mdash;Published 1842</p>

<p>In 1842 a bazaar was held in Cardiff Castle to aid in the
erection of a Church, on the site of one which had been washed
away by a flood in the river Severn (and a consequent influx of
waters into the estuary of the British Channel) two hundred
years before. Wordsworth and James Montgomery were
asked to write some verses, which might be printed and sold to
assist the cause. They did so. The following was Wordsworth’s
contribution.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">When Severn’s sweeping flood had overthrown</div>
<div class="verse">St. Mary’s Church, the preacher then would cry:&mdash;</div>

<div class="verse">Haste, and rebuild the pile.”&mdash;But not a stone <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
<div class="verse">Resumed its place. Age after age went by,</div>
<div class="verse">And Heaven still lacked its due, though piety</div>
<div class="verse">In secret did, we trust, her loss bemoan.</div>
<div class="verse">But now her Spirit hath put forth its claim</div>
<div class="verse">In Power, and Poesy would lend her voice; <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
<div class="verse">Let the new Church be worthy of its aim,</div>
<div class="verse">That in its beauty Cardiff may rejoice!</div>
<div class="verse">Oh! in the past if cause there was for shame,</div>
<div class="verse">Let not our times halt in their better choice.</div>

<h3>THE PILLAR OF TRAJAN</h3>

<p>The Fenwick note to <i>The Pillar of Trajan</i> mentions that
the author’s son having declined to attempt to compete for the
Oxford prize poem on “The Pillar of Trajan,” his father wrote
it, to show him how the thing might be done. This son&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>

considerable success; and as specimens of the poetic work of

these volumes, the following <i>Epistola ad Patrem suum</i>, written
at Madeira by John Wordsworth in 1844, may be reproduced.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_429" id="Footnote_429"></a><a href="#FNanchor_429"><span class="label">[429]</span></a> This “Ode” was printed and sung at Cambridge on the occasion of the
installation of His Royal Highness Prince Albert as Chancellor of the
University. It was published in the newspapers of the following day, as
“written for the occasion by the Poet Laureate, by royal command.”</p>

<p>There is no evidence, however, that Wordsworth wrote a single line of it.
Dr. Cradock used to attribute the authorship to the poet’s nephew, the late
Bishop of Lincoln. It is much more likely that Edward Quillinan was the
author of the whole, although Christopher Wordsworth may have revised it.
Mr. Aubrey de Vere wrote to me, November 12, 1893, “It was from Miss
Fenwick that I heard that the Laureate poem (<i>Ode, etc.</i>), was written by
Quillinan, at Wordsworth’s request, he having himself wholly failed in a
reluctant attempt to write one. If he <i>had</i> written it, I doubt much whether
he would ever have admitted it to a place among his works, for he did not
hold ‘Laureate Odes’ in honour, and had only taken the Laureateship on
the condition that he was to write none. Tennyson made the same condition:
which could not, of course, interfere with either poet addressing
lines to the Queen, if they felt specially moved from within to do so.”</p>

<p>Miss Frances Arnold writes, “Miss Quillinan was my authority for saying
that the Cambridge Ode had been written by her father, owing to the deep
depression in which Wordsworth then was.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<h3>TO MISS SELLON</h3>

<p>This sonnet exists, <i>in Wordsworth’s handwriting</i>; but it is
doubtful whether it was written by him, or not. Possibly Mr.
Quillinan wrote it. The place, and the date of composition&mdash;given
in MS.&mdash;are, “Ambleside, 22nd February, 1849.” Miss
Sellon was a relation of the late Count Cavour.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<h3>“THE WORSHIP OF THIS SABBATH MORN”</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Dorothy Wordsworth</span></p>

<p>These lines were published in <i>The Monthly Packet</i>, in July
1891, where the following note is appended by Miss Christabel
Coleridge:&mdash;“Written <i>circa</i> 1852-3, and given to Mrs. Derwent
Coleridge.” But Miss Edith Coleridge, and Mr. E. H.
Coleridge, tell me that they think they “belong to an earlier
period.” Mr. Coleridge writes, “I have heard Miss Wordsworth
repeat the lines now printed, seated in her arm-chair, on
the terrace at Rydal Mount.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

had appeared in previous editions. The “Advertisement” states
that this edition contains the whole of the published poems of the
Author, with the exception of <i>The Excursion</i>, and that a few
Sonnets “are now first published.”</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that, in this edition, Wordsworth for the
first time abandoned the practice of putting in an apostrophe,
instead of a vowel letter, in words ending with “ed,” and in
similar cases of contraction.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

were published by J. Johnson) every one of Wordsworth’s works
from 1798 to 1836&mdash;thirty in number&mdash;were introduced to the

1842, 1843, 1846, 1849, etc.; and some of the reprints contain
slight variations of text, etc. All the editions issued after 1841

Pocket edition of <i>Yarrow Revisited</i>, etc., is the third separate
issue of the Poem. It seems to have been intended as a supplementary
volume to the four vol. edition of 1832, as the sheets of
it are all imprinted ‘Vol. v.,’ but I have no direct proof that it

All the editions which I have seen contain an engraving by Mr.
Finden from the bust of Wordsworth by Chantrey&mdash;the original of
which is at Coleorton Hall&mdash;and a picture of Rydal Mount engraved
by Mr. House after Finden. Professor Dowden tells us that, in
some later editions “the Pickersgill portrait, engraved by J.
Skelton, replaces Chantrey’s bust.” In this edition, as in that of
1815, Wordsworth gave dates to his poems.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

Prelude</i> 1850, it is stated that that poem was designed to be introductory
to <i>The Recluse</i>, and that <i>The Recluse</i> if completed, would
have consisted of three parts. The second part is <i>The Excursion</i>.
The third part was only planned. The first book of the first
part was left in manuscript by Wordsworth. It was published
for the first time <i>in extenso</i> in 1888.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

merit, and permanent value. Although it is not immaculate&mdash;as
no literary work ever is&mdash;as a contribution to Wordsworthian
Literature it will hold an honoured place. Its “critical apparatus”

<h3 id="II_AMERICA">II.&mdash;<i>AMERICA</i></h3>

<p class="hanging">BIBLIOGRAPHY of the Various Editions of WORDSWORTH’S
POETICAL WORKS, which have
been printed and published in the United States of
America, from 1801 to 1895, arranged in Chronological
Order: also a <span class="smcap">Bibliography of Critical
Essays</span>, and <span class="smcap">Biographical Sketches</span>, of Wordsworth’s
Life and Works in Books, Reviews, and
Periodicals; with Notes, by Mrs. <span class="smcap">Henry A. St.
John</span>, Ithaca, New York.</p>

<h4>PREFATORY NOTE</h4>

<p>My ideal in attempting to prepare a <i>Bibliography of Wordsworth
in America</i> was high. I hoped to see each edition, or
at least to identify the editions hinted at in the various
catalogues. I determined to read every article, in criticism, or
review; and to know if the many references, given by Poole
and other authorities, were correct. As is usually the case,
the reality has fallen far short of the ideal. But, while the
results are not what were desired, there have been many
fortunate discoveries.</p>

<p>Two things were learned to begin with. First, that
astonishingly little care had been taken to preserve the history
of the early American Editions, or to preserve, even, the earlier
American Periodicals. Most of our larger libraries are
amazingly deficient in these works. Second, it was found that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
existing Catalogues or Lists are not only far from complete,
but full of gross blunders. Roorbach (the Addenda, Supplements,
etc.) was found to be a mere rehash of the old trade
sales Catalogues, swarming with blunders. In the matter of
dates, imprints, the particular editions, the size of books,
Roorbach is utterly untrustworthy. Allibone (so far as Wordsworth
is concerned) is also confusing and incomplete. I did
not find much in the various Public or College Library
Catalogues.</p>

<p>I wrote to the librarians of some of the older libraries, after
I had made out a preliminary list, to ascertain if they could
add thereto any editions, from their cards or manuscript catalogues.
From these sources I was enabled several times to
solve seemingly insolvable problems.</p>

<p>I had assistance from, and in some instances visited, the
following libraries: Cornell University, Boston Public Library,
Boston Athenæum, Harvard College, Philadelphia Public
Library, the Library College of Philadelphia, Mercantile
Library College, Philadelphia; the Public Library, St. Louis;
that of Lennox and Astor, the University of Virginia, the
State Library, Richmond, Va., and one or two other Southern
libraries. I have written more than one hundred letters to
publishers, editors, authors, the descendants of early American
Wordsworthians, Professors of Literature, and professed Wordsworthians
in Seminaries and Colleges. I have examined, or
employed others to examine, the following works for editions
of Wordsworth: the <i>New York Literary World</i>, <i>Norton’s
Literary Gazette</i>, <i>American Publishers’ Circular</i>, <i>Publishers’
Weekly</i>, <i>Catalogues of Congress Library</i>, <i>The Port Folio</i>,
<i>American Quarterly Review</i>, <i>Knickerbocker Magazine</i>, <i>New
York Quarterly Review</i>, <i>American Review</i>, <i>North American
Review</i>. And this is but half of my story.</p>

<p>Poole’s “Index,” of course, was a great assistance. But I
did not rely altogether on him, after I had discovered several
mistakes in titles and numbering&mdash;mistakes which were confusing
in the extreme. I have consulted all other Indexes
and Reference Lists that I could procure, and have carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
examined the periodicals in which it was possible that such
articles could be found.</p>

<p>My greatest light, however, came from responses to personal
appeals, to those in the North, South, East, and West of the
Country, who enlightened me in particular directions. I
needed assistance, not only to discover the articles, but more
particularly to secure the articles to read, or to procure proper
persons to read the few articles that I could not obtain.
When valuable books were sent me, by express, from distant
College Libraries, that I might read for myself, I realised the
bond there is between Wordsworthians.</p>

<p>I cannot begin to speak of the delight that I have had
in this work, delight because of the response I have met with,
and in opening up unknown and rich veins of criticism. I
have learned too, that Wordsworth has many enthusiastic
followers in America.</p>

<p>I have included in the Bibliography the accounts of visits
paid to Wordsworth by certain well-known Americans, a half-dozen
poems on Wordsworth, and three or four unpublished
Lectures.</p>

<p>I am exceedingly grateful to the many who (to my surprise)
have answered my questions, and have given me of their
valuable time. I am especially indebted to Mr. George P.
Philes, of Philadelphia, and also to Mr. F. Saunders of the
Astor Library, New York. Dean Murray of Princeton rendered
me exceedingly gracious service, and but for Mr. Edwin H.
Woodruff of Stanford University, California, I should not
have known how or where to begin my investigations.</p>

<p>In all probability my work is not perfect. I would that
it were. I only know that I have been enabled, by enthusiasm
alone, to lay a foundation for Wordsworth Bibliography in
America, that may be an assistance to future scholars, and
will aid the next Wordsworthian who is brave enough to
build enduringly.</p>

<h4>I<br />
AMERICAN EDITIONS OF WORDSWORTH</h4>

<p class="center">INCLUDING A FEW WORKS WHICH ARE NOT STRICTLY
EDITIONS OF WORDSWORTH</p>

<p>I have endeavoured to include in this list every distinctive
American edition of Wordsworth, published during the poet’s
lifetime, and since his death. There are many others, issued with
the imprints of honourable publishers; which, upon investigation,
were found to be English reprints; to say nothing of those editions
made from worn-out plates, and issued by houses of less reputation
for honourableness. I was puzzled to account for so many
editions of Matthew Arnold’s Selections, some of them bearing
the imprint of Harper Brothers, some of Macmillan, and several of
Crowell. The Harpers wrote me that these various publications
were possible in view of the fact that there was no copyright of the
work, and that all of them might properly be called American
Editions. I have not placed those bearing the Macmillan imprint,
of course, among purely American editions. Nor have I included
the several cheap ones of Crowell. The one of Crowell, given in
the list, is copyrighted by the Crowell Company.</p>

<p>The fact that the introduction of Wordsworth’s poetry into
America is so easily authenticated, and that the history of it is so
concise, is my apology for deviating from ordinary bibliographical
rule in including among the regular editions certain numbers of
America’s first Literary Journal, and two or three other volumes.</p>

<p>I have confined myself to a simple chronological arrangement of
the Editions, with place of imprint, name of publisher, number,
and size of volumes. This makes the most convenient list for easy
reference, especially as I have tried to mention technical points of
difference.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_478" id="Footnote_478"></a><a href="#FNanchor_478"><span class="label">[478]</span></a> <i>Simon Lee</i> was probably the first poem of Wordsworth’s published
in a Literary Journal in America, and is the beginning of
Wordsworth’s Bibliography in U.S.A. A note in “The Port
Folio” (vol. i. p. 24) is as follows: “The public may remember
reading in some of the newspapers the interesting little ballads, <i>We
are Seven</i>, and <i>Goody Blake and Harry Gill</i>. They were extracted
from the ‘Lyrical Ballads,’ a collection remarkable for originality,
simplicity, and nature.… The following, <i>Simon Lee</i>, is from
the same work.”</p>

<p>It is evident from this that two, at least, of Wordsworth’s poems
were copied into American newspapers as early as 1800, and that
Joseph Dennie, the founder, as well as editor, of “The Port Folio”&mdash;the
first purely Literary Journal established in this country&mdash;was
the first American champion of Wordsworth.</p>

its publication in England. It was the first poem of Wordsworth’s
published in a book in America. It was also the first instance of

printed in America. It looks as if the Poet found
appreciative readers in America sooner than in England; the first
edition of “Lyrical Ballads,” which had fallen dead in his own
country in 1798, being published in Philadelphia in 1802. The
American edition was delayed in the press, in order to include
certain pieces which first appeared in the second (English) edition
of 1802. See Humphreys’ Preface.</p>

<p>A copy of “Lyrical Ballads,” 1802, is in the possession of
Judge Henry Reed, with exactly the same title-page as the above,
except that it reads&mdash;</p>

<p>“Printed by James Humphreys for Joseph Groff.”</p>

<p>It is believed that the work was printed at the joint expense of
Humphreys and Groff, each bookseller taking a certain number of
copies upon which was placed his individual imprint. Both book-sellers
advertised the volumes almost simultaneously. I know of
another copy of (1802) “Lyrical Ballads,” of which the first
volume contains the imprint of Humphreys, and the second
volume that of Groff. The two volumes are bound together, and
are <i>identical</i> in type, paper, etc.</p>

<h4>II<br />
REPRINTS, AND BOOKS, BOTH ENGLISH
AND AMERICAN</h4>

<p>A Bibliography of Wordsworth in America is not complete
without some reference to the many editions of Wordsworth, and
of works pertaining to him, which have&mdash;for the most part&mdash;appeared
simultaneously in England and America. These works
cannot properly be termed American, but they have been welcomed,
and they have also supplied a want, on this side of the Atlantic.
The editions are confined, for the most part, to the last twenty
years. I have endeavoured to select those which are of most
value.</p>

<h4>IV<br />
REVIEW AND MAGAZINE ARTICLES ON
WORDSWORTH PUBLISHED IN AMERICA</h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">From 1801 to 1840</span></p>

<p>In examining American Reviews and Magazines, for articles
on Wordsworth, I find&mdash;after much laborious search&mdash;only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
some insignificant notices of his poems, of no critical or literary
merit.</p>

<p>I have carefully read each article which appears in this list,
and I add brief explanatory notes, indicative of the general
tenor of the articles. It was disheartening to find that many of
the references to Wordsworth, in Poole’s elaborate <i>Index to
Periodical Literature</i>, were inaccurate and misleading; and
that nearly all the articles on Wordsworth published in <i>Harper’s
Monthly Magazine</i> for 1850 were “conveyed” from contemporary
English journals.</p>

<h4>V<br />
CRITICISMS AND REVIEWS IN PERIODICALS
FROM 1840 TO 1870</h4>

<p>Arranged as far as possible according to merit. It is difficult
to distinguish between the first twelve or fifteen. After them
I have placed the articles in the <i>Literary World</i>. Most of
them have not been noted in other lists, and are especially
interesting, as being additional tributes of Wordsworth’s intimate
friend, Henry Reed. I am indebted to Judge Henry Reed of
Philadelphia, for more carefully examining his father’s papers, and
to the <i>Literary World</i> for ascertaining, as far as possible, all that
his father wrote on Wordsworth. The criticisms that immediately
follow are not without interest. The last half dozen are
given, for the most part, because they appear in <i>Poole’s Index</i>,
or in other lists. I have omitted two or three which are of no
value whatever.</p>

<h4>III<br />
INFLUENCE</h4>

<p>Wordsworth’s influence on French literature was altogether
very slight, nor did it make itself felt till about 1830; when,
after a very limited period, it silently died away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span></p>

<p>Wordsworth was but little known by his contemporary
Châteaubriand, who merely names him among other poets in
his <i>Essai sur la Littérature anglaise</i>. Byron, Walter Scott,
and in a lesser degree Thomas Moore, were the only writers
of Great Britain whose works told on our literature at that
time. Villemain, in his criticism of Byron, contemptuously
dismisses all the so-called lake-poets to fix on his hero. He
calls them: “Des métaphysiciens, raisonneurs sans invention,
mélancoliques sans passion, qui, dans l’éternelle rêverie d’une
vie étroite et peu agitée, n’avaient produit que des singularités
sans puissance sur l’imagination des autres hommes. Tel était
Woodsworth (<i>sic</i>) et le subtil mais non touchant Coléridge.”</p>

<p>To Byron also, and to him alone (Ossian being excepted)
among the poets of England, was Lamartine indebted. I am
not sure that he names Wordsworth once; but still the striking
analogy between the ideas and imaginative style of both
cannot fail to be noticed by the reader. Without insisting
on a parallel that might be drawn between many pages of <i>The
Excursion</i> and of <i>Jocelyn</i>, I will only point out two short pieces
of Lamartine that bear strong resemblance to two poems of
Wordsworth, so much so that they almost read like free
imitations&mdash;</p>

<p>M. Sully Prudhomme when he wrote <i>A l’Hirondelle</i>
(stanzas, la vie intérieure) appears to have borne in mind <i>To a
Skylark</i>, “Ethereal minstrel,” etc.</p>

<p>M. Coppée has often been called a French Wordsworth,
owing to his poetical collection called <i>Les Humbles</i>, wherein he
shows the same partiality as the English Poet does for humble
themes and characters, together with a bold attempt to naturalise
trivial or ludicrous details in serious poetry; but there is no
proof, as far as I know, of Wordsworth’s influence having been
strong upon him.</p>

<p>If we except two or three disciples of Wordsworth, neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
he, nor the lake-poets taken as a whole, seem to have been
much thought of, or even read, by our contemporary verse-writers.
The word <i>Lakist</i> has generally been used as a
synonym for “weak and doleful mysticism.” Ex.:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Revue Encyclopédique.</i> 1831. Article de Pierre Leroux,
sur la “Poésie de notre Époque.” “L’Angleterre a entendu
autour de ses lacs bourdonner comme des ombres plaintives un
essaim de poètes abîmés dans une mystique contemplation.”</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Journal d’un Poète</i>, par Alfred de Vigny. (Ed. Michel
Lévy. 1867. p. 80.) “Barbier vient de publier <i>Il Pianto</i>.
Les délices de Capone ont amolli son caractère de poésie et
Brizeux a déteint sur lui ses douces couleurs virgiliennes et
laquistes (<i>sic</i>) dérivant de Sainte-Beuve.”</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <span class="smcap">Théophile Gautier</span> (<i>Portraits Contemporains</i>, p. 174)
almost seems to derive the word <i>Lakiste</i> from Lamartine’s poem
called <i>Le Lac</i>. He has just mentioned the poem and goes
on: “Il ne faut pas croire que Lamartine, parce qu’il y
a toujours chez lui une vibration et une résonnance de harpe
éolienne, ne soit qu’un mélodieux <i>lakiste</i> et ne sache que
soupirer mollement la mélancolie et l’amour. S’il a le soupir,
il a la parole et le cri …” (<i>Journal Officiel</i>, 8 Mars 1869.)</p>

<p>I now come to the man who, first and foremost among our
poets and critics, paid due homage to Wordsworth, <i>i.e.</i> Sainte-Beuve.
I have already enumerated his several translations in
verse from Wordsworth. Strange to say, the voluminous critic
has no single article with Wordsworth for its main subject; but,
whoever will go through his many volumes will find many
judicious and admiring references to the poet.</p>

<p>Moreover, as a poet, Sainte-Beuve has endeavoured to
naturalise in France the poetic style that has been associated
with the name of Wordsworth. He expressly claims Wordsworth
as one of his masters in his <i>Consolations</i> xviii. “A
Antony Deschamps.” Among his bosom-poets he reckons&mdash;</p>

<div class="verse">A travers les soupirs de la mousse et de l’onde,</div>
<div class="verse">Distingue, au soir, des chants venus d’un meilleur monde.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The original attempt of Sainte-Beuve (for he was original in
his very choice of Wordsworth as a model at a time when Byron
engrossed all the admiration of the French poets) has been ably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
characterised by Théophile Gautier in his “Portraits Contemporains”
(pp. 208, 209), an article reprinted from <i>La Gazette de
Paris</i>, 19 Novembre 1871:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“(Sainte-Beuve) avait été en poésie un inventeur. Il avait
donné une note nouvelle et toute moderne, et de tout le cénacle
c’était à coup sûr le plus réellement romantique. Dans cette
humble poésie qui rappelle par la sincérité du sentiment et la
minutie du détail observé sur nature, les vers de Crabbe, de
Wordsworth, et de Cowper, Sainte-Beuve s’est frayé de petits
sentiers à mi-côte, bordés d’humbles fleurettes, où nul en France
n’a passé avant lui. Sa facture un peu laborieuse et compliquée
vient de la difficulté de réduire à la forme métrique des idées et
des images non exprimées encore ou dédaignées jusque-là, mais
que de morceaux merveilleusement venus où l’effort n’est plus
sensible!”</p>

</div>

<p>Sainte-Beuve’s admiration of Wordsworth is a well-known
fact. Less generally known is the influence of this admiration
on several poets of that time (<i>circa</i> 1830-40), who, either through
Sainte-Beuve’s imitations, or with a direct knowledge of Wordsworth’s
poems, to the reading of which they had thus been
stimulated, offer great marks of resemblance with Wordsworth.
I have quoted a judgment of De Vigny that considers
Brizeux and Barbier as having turned <i>laquistes</i> through Sainte-Beuve.
I know no other immediate proof of this influence.
Perhaps Barbier and Brizeux have consigned it somewhere.
Anyhow Brizeux with his glorification of his youthful years and
school-time, with his intense love of his native Brittany, his
fond attachment to local customs and habits, his lamentations
on the death of the poetical poet as embodied in his own province
(<i>Élégie de la Bretagne</i>), is to all extent and purposes the
most thoroughly Wordsworthian of all our poets. There may
be more of Wordsworth’s <i>philosophy</i> in Lamartine, but there is
more of his <i>poetry</i> proper in Brizeux.</p>

<p>The influence of Wordsworth on Maurice de Guérin and
Hippolyte de la Morvonnais, is more easily ascertained than the
preceding. Here, again, Sainte-Beuve appears to have been
the intermediate agent.<a name="FNanchor_582" id="FNanchor_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a></p>

<p>In 1832-33 Maurice de Guérin, fresh from the reading of
the <i>Consolations</i>, and De la Morvonnais, who came to be a direct
admirer of the Lake Poets, and chiefly of Wordsworth, set to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
write short poems which they aspired to make as little different
from prose as possible, rejecting all traditional ornaments, and
making little of the rhythmical improvements of the <i>Romantiques</i>
proper. Some of those pieces were inserted in a local paper as
downright prose (no stop intervening at the end of the lines),
whereas the said paper would not have made room for verse.<a name="FNanchor_583" id="FNanchor_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a>
This looks like trifling, but the earnestness of this attempted
revolution is shown in the interesting poems of Maurice de
Guérin. Another outcome of this was an intended publication
on Wordsworth, of which it is impossible to say whether it was
to be a criticism, or a translation, of the English Poet. It is
thus mentioned in a letter of Guérin to De la Morvonnais of
June 30, 1836: “Nous avons adressé des circulaires à un
grand nombre d’éditeurs pour l’impression Wordsworth. Nous
attendons la réponse d’un moment à l’autre.” The answer
must have been unfavourable, as nothing more was heard of the
intended publication.</p>

<p>The early death of Guérin left it for De la Morvonnais alone
to spread the influence of Wordsworth’s poetry in France. Of
him we read in Sainte-Beuve’s <i>Étude sur Maurice de Guérin</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“La Morvonnais, vers ce temps même (1834), en était fort
préoccupé (des lakistes et de leur poésie), au point d’aller visiter
Wordsworth à sa résidence de Rydal Mount, près des lacs du
Westmoreland, et de rester en correspondance avec ce grand et
pacifique esprit, avec ce patriarche de la Muse intime. Guérin,
sans tant y songer, ressemblait mieux aux Lakistes en ne visant
nullement à les imiter.”</p>

</div>

<p>Of the supposed correspondence between Wordsworth and
De la Morvonnais no trace remains. M. Hippolyte de la
Blanchardière, De la Morvonnais’ grandson, has informed me
that in the collection of his grandfather’s letters there is no
letter of Wordsworth to be found. That at least a Study of
Wordsworth existed at the time is proved by the following
preface to his poem <i>La Thébaïde des Grèves</i>, written by his friend
A. Duquesnel (ed. by Didier, Quai des Augustins. 1864.
p. xxvii.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nous avons trouvé dans les <i>Reliquiae</i> du poète de
l’Arguenon<a name="FNanchor_584" id="FNanchor_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> de précieuses études sur les lakistes. Il s’était
passionné pour ces hommes dans les dix dernières années de
sa vie (1843-53).<a name="FNanchor_585" id="FNanchor_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> Wordsworth lui semblait plus grand que
Byron, qu’il trouvait trop emphatique, trop solennel, pas assez
près de la nature. L’auteur de <i>l’Excursion</i> a exercé une pénétrante
influence sur l’esprit et le cœur de la Morvonnais,
nous trouvons dans ses cahiers des traductions en vers de
Wordsworth, de Coléridge, de Crabbe, qui, lui, ne faisait pas
partie de ce groupe. Nous les publierons peut-être un jour;
elles ont d’autant plus d’intérêt que l’on ne connaît guère les
lakistes en France, que par de rares extraits. Il s’était livré,
comme on le verra, à une étude approfondie de la littérature
anglaise. Son admiration pour Walter Scott était inexprimable.”</p>

</div>

<p>The study and translations above-mentioned have also been
lost, many manuscripts of De la Morvonnais having been
destroyed.</p>

<p>It remains for me to point out some allusions to, or imitations
of, Wordsworth in the existing verse of De la Morvonnais.</p>

<p>In the <i>Thébaïde des Grèves</i> (1838), “Le Petit Patour” is a

<p>I pass over many sonnets, and divers other poems, in which
the influence of Wordsworth is unmistakable, and come to a
last quotation which is useful to elucidate an allusion in Wordsworth’s
<i>The Poet’s Dream: Sequel to the Norman Boy</i>. In
this poem, written in 1842, Wordsworth says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But oh! that Country-man of thine, whose eye, loved Child, can see</div>
<div class="verse">A pledge of endless bliss in acts of early piety,</div>
<div class="verse">In verse, which to thy ear might come, would treat this simple theme,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor leave untold our happy flight in that adventurous dream.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As Wordsworth read very little French poetry in his old age,
I think he here alludes to a poem of his admirer De la Morvonnais,
who very likely sent him that <i>Thébaïde des Grèves</i>
(1838), in which Wordsworth was so highly praised. The
passage alluded to is taken from “Solitude,” and reads thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Enfant, Il (Dieu) te promet le domaine de l’ange</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Si tu gardes l’amour et la foi des aïeux,</div>
<div class="verse">Et sa mère, aujourd’hui loin de l’humaine fange,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Que tu n’as pas connue et qui t’attend aux cieux.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As a whole, De la Morvonnais, though he imitates Wordsworth,
is very unlike him. Of course I do not mean to
compare the two, but even in like subjects he differs from
Wordsworth, owing to a sort of constitutional nervousness and
brooding melancholy.<a name="FNanchor_586" id="FNanchor_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a></p>

Volumes <span class="smcapuc">I.</span> and <span class="smcapuc">II.</span> (see the prefatory note to this volume), and
also that of Mr. Hill. It was due to my returning, “for

<p>2. Vol. ii. p. 106, <i>Ruth</i>, l. 54&mdash;The following extract

<p>Proceeding on our return to town in the cool of the evening …
we enjoyed a most enchanting view; … companies
of young innocent Cherokee virgins, some busy gathering the rich
fragrant fruit, others having already filled their baskets, lay reclined
under the shade of floriferous and fragrant native bowers …
disclosing their beauties to the fluttering breeze … whilst other
parties, more gay and libertine, were yet collecting strawberries, or
wantonly chasing their companions, tantalising them, staining their
lips and cheeks with the ripe fruit.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
